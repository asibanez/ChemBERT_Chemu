To understand these novel processes , 3a-hydroxyisoxazolo- [3,2-a]isoindol-8(3aH)-one derivative 3 and (E)-3-methylene- isoindolin-1-one 4a were treated under diﬀerent conditions ( Scheme 2 ). We found that compound 3a could be eﬀectively transformed to (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a in the presence of a catalytic amount of both K2CO3 and Bu3P at 60 ° C , while it was fully transformed to (Z)-3-methylene- isoindolin-1-one 5a at 150 ° C in the presence of Bu3P or at 100 ° C in the presence of K2CO3. We also found that (E)-3- methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a could be eﬀectively transformed to (Z)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 5a in the presence of a catalytic amount of both K2CO3 and Bu3P at a higher temperature , which shows a novel example that the (E)- conﬁguration of the carbon − carbon double bond could be transformed to the (Z)-conﬁguration of the carbon − carbon double bond. It is worth mentioning here that compound 3a could also be transformed to (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a and (Z)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 5a in the absence of catalyst , and compound 4a could also be transformed to its isomer 5a. There is an obvious intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the N − H group of 5a in its crystal structure , and this could be the cause of the Z-stereoselectivity under higher temperature.13	0

ABSTRACT : Naphthalene - bridged bis-triazole ( NBT ) com- plexes were prepared and characterized for investigation of their photophysical properties. Unlike our previously reported N-2-aryl triazoles , which gave strong emissions through the planar intramolecular charge transfer mechanism ( coplanar conformation ) , this newly developed NBT adopted a non- coplanar conformation between triazole and naphthalene , achieving ﬂuorescence through twisted intramolecular charge transfer .	0
In some cases , the HRMS analysis of the reaction mixture revealed the formation of desired porphyrinogen intermediates ( 7e − h ) , which disappeared without providing corresponding porphodimethene products upon oxidation with DDQ or p- chloranil. To understand the detailed mechanism of reaction , the intermediate porphyrinogens ( 7e − h ) were isolated and characterized. These porphyrinogens ( 7e − h ) were further oxidized under neutral conditions. Porphodimethenes ( 5e − h ) were obtained by condensation of 1 equiv of tripyrranes ( 4a and 4b ) with 1 equiv of the corresponding diol ( 3e − h ) in the presence of BF3-methanol using dichloromethane as a solvent ( 3.2 mM ) at 0 ° C for 1 h , and then the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 45 min ( method B ). The crude porphyrinogens were puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatog- raphy to aﬀord white solids in 10 − 14 % yield. The methyl- substituted porphyrinogens ( 7e and 7f ) were oxidized with chloranil , and meso-unsubstituted porphyrinogens ( 7g and 7h ) were oxidized with 0.1 % aqueous FeCl3 in CHCl3 at room temperature to obtain 16π-conjugated systems 5e in 6 % , 5f in 7 % , 5g in 5 % , and 5h in 4 % yields ( Scheme 2 ).

Further application of the indium - catalyzed condensation to a variety of aldehydes 8 , except for benzaldehyde with dimethyl malonate ( 2a ) , was then investigated in the presence of Ac2O ( Table 4 ). When 4-formylpyridine ( 8a ) was used as a substrate , the corresponding alkene product 9aa was obtained in 65 % yield ( entry 1 ). In this case , InCl3 was unnecessary for the con- densation based on the fact that alkene 9aa ( 68 % NMR yield ) was obtained in the absence of InCl3. When the reactions of either a pyridyl aldehyde , which have a more sterically hindered portion around the nitrogen atom , 2-bromo-6-formylpyridine ( 8b ) , or 2-thiophenyl aldehyde ( 8c ) with malonate ester 2a were treated with our optimal conditions , the extended π-conjugate heteroaromatic compounds 9ba and 9ca were obtained in good yields ( entries 2 and 3 ). Also , the present Knoevenagel condensation could be applied to either a conjugated or an aliphatic aldehyde in addition to an aromatic aldehyde. For example , a conjugated aldehyde , (E)-cinnamal- dehyde ( 8d ) , reacted with the malonate ester to aﬀord α , β , γ , δ-unsaturated carbonyl compound 9da in 79 % yield , which retained the double - bond geometry ( entry 4 ).

Single - crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses and DFT calculations were performed for neutral donors 1 and 2 and their respective dicationic states 12+ and 22+ to examine their molecular structures. Figure 1 shows ORTEP drawings of 1b and 2b and optimized structures for 1b2+ and 2b2+. Crystal data , data collection , and reduction parameters for crystals 1a , 1b , 2a , and 2b and selected bond lengths and torsion angles of 1a , 1b , and 2b are summarized in Table 2 and Table S1 of the Supporting Information. The bond length was successfully determined with a high degree of accuracy in the crystal structures of 1a , 1b , and 2b , which allowed us to examine the bonding characteristics of these compounds. Because disorder in the thienothiophene ring of 2a made it diﬃcult to determine the precise bond lengths , structural data for 2a were excluded ′ ( 1 ) , and from the discussion. The CA −CC bond , indicating CC the formation of a quinoidal structure , which is consistent with the optimized molecular structure obtained using DFT calculations ( see Tables S2 and S3 of the Supporting Information ). The terminal aryl moieties and central thiophene ring are twisted because of steric repulsion between hydrogens on the aryl group and hydrogen or sulfur on the thiophene ring. Dicationic species 12+ and 22+ are relatively unstable toward moisture , which made it diﬃcult to grow a single crystal that was suitable for X-ray analysis. Thus , we performed DFT calculations at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level of theory. In contrast −CB bonds in to those of neutral donors 1 and 2 , the CA −CC bonds ( Table dications 12+ and 22+ are longer than the CB S4 of the Supporting Information ) , which reﬂects a benzenoid molecular structure. This switching of the quinoid − benzenoid structure based on electron transfer should be interesting with regard to the change in photophysical properties. Next , we examined photophysical properties. Figure 2 shows UV − vis and ﬂuorescence spectra of 1 and 2 in dichloro- methane. Thienoquinoid 1a showed strong absorption in the visible region at 422 nm , which can be assigned to the HOMO − LUMO transition of the thienoquinoid substructure , which was supported by DFT calculations [ B3LYP / 6-31G(d) ( see Figure 3)]. Extension of the central π-electron unit from a thienoquinoid unit to a thienothienoquinoid unit caused a huge red shift of 44 nm for 2a in contrast to that of 1a due to narrowing of the HOMO − LUMO gap through the extension of π-conjugation. The absorption spectra of 1 and 2 were also strongly aﬀected by the substituents on the terminal aryl moieties. The introduction of both electron - donating methoxy units and electron - accepting chloro atoms on phenyl moieties caused a red shift. Table 1 summarizes the energy levels of	0
Stereoselective Synthesis of 2b. We next examined the stereoselective synthesis of the second target molecule 2b , which is the C6 - epimer of 2a. We envisioned the stereo- the C6 position by the oxidation − reduction inversion at process. Thus , selective protection of the primary hydroxy the diol 20 with TESCl / imidazole yielded the group of secondary alcohol , which was subjected to the TPAP oxidation19 to aﬀord ketone 23 ( Scheme 7 ). Diastereoselective reduction of 23 with NaBH4 proceeded successfully to provide the desired alcohol 24 in 98 % yield as the sole diastereomer. This stereochemical outcome is in line with a Felkin − Anh model , which is doubly eﬀected by the C5 and C7 stereogenic centers. The 1H NMR spectrum of 24 was clearly diﬀerent from that of the secondary alcohol obtained in the ﬁrst step	0
strongly suggest a preferential bidentate binding mode. The assumption of a 1 : 2 complex is required to explain the minor chemical - shift perturbations upon the addition of 10 − 100 equiv , which implies that the second complexation step only becomes relevant if an excess of guest is provided ( see the speciation curve in Figure 3 , bottom ). The trend for the K1 values ( Table 1 ) shows a general preference for more charge- dense / basic halides as the bond acceptor ( Cl− > Br− > I− ) , which allows for a stronger electrostatic as well as charge- transfer interaction. Nevertheless , the soft halides are also strongly bound , which is tentatively assigned to a larger covalent contribution toward the halogen bond interactions compared to that of the analogous hydrogen bond systems.29,33 In comparison to the halides , the complexation of acetate , dihydrogen phosphate , and sulfate is much stronger , which was also found previously in analogous studies43 and is rationalized by the higher basicity of the selected oxo-anions. The observed slight preference for dihydrogen phosphate over acetate is contrary to the higher charge density and basicity of acetate and is thus ascribed to a better ﬁt between the receptor ’s cavity and the tetrahedral anion. The observation of the highest anion aﬃnity in the case of sulfate is rationalized by its doubly negative charge , which provides a signiﬁcantly enhanced charge assistance.29,53,76	0
First , we investigated the feasibility of the intended synthetic approach to the target pyrazole scaﬀold by exploring the reactivity of N-propargyl carboxylic acid 612 for the synthesis of α,β-alkynyl ketones. Acid 6 was treated with thionyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine in THF at room temperature. The resulting acid chloride 7 was then condensed in situ with the substituted trimethylsilyl acetylenes to furnish the corresponding α,β-acetylenic ketones 8 ( Scheme 2 ) .	0

photoreductive process. Control experiments revealed that a photocatalyst , 4 and visible light were essential for the eﬃcient conversion of 1a into 2a ( entries 7 − 10 ). Finally , we evaluated several frequently employed photocatalysts in the debromina- tion of 1a under otherwise identical conditions. While Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 compared favorably with 3 in terms of yield ( entry 11 vs entry 5 ) , Ru(phen)3Cl2 ( phen = 1,10-phenanthro- line ) and Ir(ppy)3 ( ppy = 2-phenylpyridine ) proved to be less eﬀective than 3 in terms of diastereoselectivity and yield , respectively ( entries 13 and 14 ).

Due to the steric bulkiness of the tert-butyl groups , the ring - opening reaction of 1a with 2,6- di-tert-butylphenol did not aﬀord any desired product ( Table 3 , entry 18 ).

would seem that such an approach has much less chance of success than the synthesis macrocycles consisting of identical units. However , we have proven that , by using thermodynami- cally driven acid - catalyzed condensations , it can be very eﬀective. The obtained products extend the pool of relatively easy available macrocycles for various applications in supra- molecular chemistry. We predict that the rich chemistry of the phenolic group , including O - substitution , allows for easy functionalization of the currently obtained skeletons for their further modiﬁcations. Presence of two diﬀerent types of units in one macrocycle allows for potential applications as “ biased ” supramolecular structures,48,49 and diﬀerentiation of reactivity enables selective introduction of orthogonal or multiple functions .	0

A possible pathway for the gallium - catalyzed generation of dihydrobenzofuran - linked oxindoles 4 and 5 is outlined in Scheme 4. Initially , Ga(OTf)3 acts as a Lewis acid interacting with the allene and phenol moieties simultaneously via a bidentade mode. The formation of a complex 1-Ga through both π-coordination of the metal to the allene group of allenols 1 and σ-coordination to the hydroxy group of phenols 2 may be involved. Subsequent nucleophilic addition of the phenol moiety at the sterically less hindered carbon center in complex 1-Ga would lead to a ketone intermediate , which after tautomerization aﬀorded the more stable enol - form 8. Then , from zwitterionic an elimination of water and Ga(OTf)3 intermediate 8 occurs to generate gallium species 9 through η- coordination of the gallium salt to the more substituted double bond. Species 9 suﬀers an intramolecular chemo- and regioselective 5-exo-trig oxycyclization reaction to produce zwitterionic dihydrobenzofurans 10. This nucleophilic attack from the O-phenol site occurs as a result of the stability of the intermediate oxonium type cation 10. Loss of HOTf in zwitterionic dihydrobenzofurans 10 generates neutral metal species 11. Finally , protonolysis of the carbon − gallium bond of 11 liberates dihydrobenzofurans 4 and 5 with concomitant regeneration of the Ga(III) catalytic species ( Scheme 4 ) .	0

Coupling constants are another major parameter obtained by NMR spectroscopy that has shown to be able to obey linear free energy relationships with Hammett ’s σ constants of the substituents.11,12 In general , the magnitude of a coupling constant depends on the number of bonds intervening between the two interacting atoms or groups of atoms. In addition , the electronegativity of potential attached atoms or inﬂuence also plays a groups together with stereochemical for the coupling signiﬁcant role. Further , constants the atoms involved.13,14 Since the coupling constant is a physical parameter that is expressed as a function of the electronic distribution within the molecule it will also reﬂect diﬀerences in the electronic structure brought about by the presence of diﬀerent substituents. This correlation can be expressed as a linear free energy relationship in the same manner as in eq 1. It is important that the change of the physical parameter that is monitored is convincingly large when constructing Hammett plots. Data obtained using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy is often used as the input to Hammett plots , and	0

1-BDP and (Zn)2 - (BDP)2 , which facilitates electron transfer from photoexcited chlorin to BODIPY. is known that phenylethynyl-type linkers provide strong electronic coupling between dyads ’ components and promote ultrafast PET.39 Electronic communication between BODIPY and chlorin can be inferred from absorption and emission spectra of 1-BDP and (Zn)2 - (BDP)2 , which show slight bathochromic shift of both Qy absorption and emission bands , and increased ﬂuorescence quantum yields ( in toluene ) of chlorin components , compared to the benchmark monomers ( see Table 1 ). For 3-BDP and 4-BDP , both absorption and emission maxima and ﬂuorescence quantum yields are identical to those for the corresponding benchmark monomers , which suggests that there is a negligible conjugation between chlorin and BODIPY , which , in turn , may lead to an attenuation of photoinduced electron transfer. However , further systematic time - resolved spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of quenching of ﬂuorescence for chlorin components in arrays. In order to further evaluate the applicability of amide - linked BODIPY − chlorin dyads for bioimaging , we compared the quantum yields of ﬂuorescence for the chlorin component in arrays upon excitation at the BODIPY absorption , in various solvents ( toluene , MeOH , DMSO , DMF ; Table S1 , Supporting Information ). The data show that the dyads 3-BDP , 4-BDP , and Zn4 - BDP retain relatively high ﬂuorescence quantum yields in solvents of diﬀerent polarities. Fluorescence for these arrays is comparable in toluene , DMF , and DMSO , and modestly reduced in MeOH ( on average ﬂuorescence quantum yields in MeOH are 0.71-fold of that in toluene ). Finally , we compared the ﬂuorescence intensity for dyads vs monomers upon excitation at ∼ 500 nm , at the same concentration. We ob- served 5.2-fold and 4.7-fold increases for 3-BDP and 5.5-fold and 5.2-fold for 4-BDP in toluene and DMF , respectively .	0

With regard to glycosylation with 2-acetamido-2-deoxyga- lactosyl diethyl phosphite 11 , 3 equiv of 3-O-unprotected galactoside 13 was employed as an acceptor since galactoside 13 could be easily prepared from inexpensive galactose on a large scale and the unreacted alcohol could be quantitatively recovered after column chromatography.

The method was extended to such acceptors as 3m and 3n ( Table 2 , Entries 5 and 6 ) with the 6-OH free and disaccharides 7e and 7f readily obtained in 77 % and 86 % yields with excellent stereoselectivity , respectively. These results indicated that 6α might be an appropriate donor to construct β-mannosidic ( 1 → 6 ) linkages. Additionally , easy access to disaccharide thioglycosides 4a , 4d , 7b , and 7e opens up new prospects for the synthesis of β- mannosyl fragment - containing oligosaccharides because they could be immediately utilized as donors in their next coupling reaction. The conﬁguration of newly generated glycosidic bonds was unambiguously assigned by both chemical shift of H-5 and one- bond coupling constant ( 1JCH ) of anomeric center derived from mannosyl units. The former appeared in a region ranging from 2.9 to 3.3 ppm as a multiplet,2d which is diagnostic for 4,6-O- benzylindene protected β-mannoside ( see Section A in SI ).

We initiated our studies by examining the reaction of allenyl sulfonamide 4a with propylamine 5a. Imidazole 6a was not detected when 4a and 5a were reacted in CH3CN at room temperature ( Table 1 , entry 1 ). Fortunately , in the presence of a base ( K2CO3 ) , the reaction in reﬂuxing CH3CN gave imidazole 6a in 39 % yield ( entry 2 ). Addition of 2 equiv of 5a gave a better yield ( entry 3 ). Subsequent screening of solvent and base showed that DMF proved to be the most suitable solvent ( entries 4 − 7 ) , whereas K2CO3 was the best base ( entries 8 − 10 ). Thus , we concluded that K2CO3 as base in DMF at 100 ° C under air provided the sole product imidazole 6a in the highest yield ( 87 % , entry 5 ) .	0

Although traditionally cyano(hetero)arenes were synthe- sized from corresponding aldehydes and their derivatives or halides,3 over few decades , selective and direct cyanation4 of highly abundant C − H bonds of (hetero)arenes has emerged as a powerful tool to achieve atom- and step- economy in organic synthesis.5 In this context , the most documented direct cyanation of indoles is the transition metal mediated / catalyzed C3 - selective cyanation,6 which is probably due to the inherent property of indoles ( Scheme 1 ). Typically , indoles can be achieved using isocyanato- C3 - cyanation of phosphoric triphenylthiocyanogen (TPPT)8 as the cyanating reagent. Recently , these strategies were replaced with transition metal catalyzed cyanation of indoles employing tBuNC,9 TMEDA / NH3,10 DMF,11 DMF / NH4I,12 DMSO / NH4HCO3,13 metal cyanides,14 BnCN,15 3,5- (CF3)2C6H3I(OTf)CN,16 and N-cyano-N-phenyl-p-toluenesul- fonamide ( NCTS ). 17 However , the closely related C2- selective cyanation of indoles and related heteroarenes is rather limited .	0

asymmetric alkyne addition to aldehydes is almost completely maintained. There is little change in the enantiomeric purity in the ether formation step as well as in the domino cyclization step. In this domino cycloaddition process , four new chiral centers including a quaternary chiral carbon core are formed. The structure of 4a was established by high - resolution mass 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis and various spectroscopic analyses , including COSY , NOESY , HSQC , and DEPT - 135 ( Figure 1 ). In the 1H NMR spectrum of 4a , the signals at δ 3.61 ( d , 1H , J = 3.2 Hz ) , 3.75 ( dd , 1H , J = 12.8 , 8 Hz ) , and 4.16 ( t , 1H , J = 7.2 Hz ) are attributed to H1 , H2 , and H3 , respectively. The 1H NMR signal of H11 at δ 1.07 is shifted unusually upﬁeld in comparison with that of H10 at δ 2.08 on the same carbon. We attribute this to the shielding eﬀect of the Ph group of 4a on H11. In the 13C NMR spectrum , the carbonyl signal of 4a is observed at δ 211.5 and the TMS-substituted vinyl carbon signal is observed at δ 192.6. The carbon bearing H1 gives a signal at δ 80.9 and that bearing H2 and H3 at δ 69.7 .	0

Furthermore , two phenyl-substituted real systems are also considered to evaluate the electronic eﬀects. The corresponding optimized structures are shown in the Supporting Information.  H , MG = H ) , the phenyl group is For case 1 ( R1 = phenyl , R2 placed at the C5 position in the azirine motif , whereas for case 2 ( R1 = CH3 , R2 = phenyl , MG = H ) , the phenyl group is placed at the alkyne terminal ( C1 position ). As shown in Table 1 , ‡ compared with the nonsubstituted reaction , both ΔG of the ﬁrst step ( 5-endo-dig cyclization ) increase by 2 − 3 kcal / mol in the substituted reactions , which can be attributed to electron delocalization reducing the nucleophilic / electrophilic activity. For case 1 , the phenyl group at the C5 atom can stabilize the carbocation in intermediate r-IM-1 , leading to the decrease in the corresponding energy. Therefore , the rate - determining step becomes 5-endo-dig cyclization in case 1. For case 2 , the repulsion between phenyl ( at the C1 position of alkyne ) and tertiary butyl of the ligand would push the free energy barrier slightly higher. From r-CM1 to r-IM-1 in case 2 , the phenyl group rotates ∼ 60 ° , making phenyl and tertiary butyl approach each other. Therefore , for the transition state of ring - expansion in case 2 , the distance between the phenyl and tertiary butyl groups would be slightly suppressed along with ring - expansion , resulting in more repulsion. Accordingly , ΔG of ring expansion in case 2 is 6.94 ‡ kcal / mol from the intermediate , and the overall ΔG reaches 21.79 kcal / mol , which is higher than the other two real reaction systems described above .	0
Interconversion of Bisboronates. Given the diﬀerential reactivity of the B(mida) , B(aam) , and B(dan) groups , we next sought to exploit these diﬀerences in the orthogonal interconversion of diﬀerentially protected bisboro- nate systems. Accordingly , the vinyl-B(pin) / B(mida) bisboronate 18 with KHF2 yielded selective ﬂuorolysis of the pinacol boronate to give the vinyl-BF3K / B(mida) bisboronate 19 in 63 % yield ( Scheme 1 ) , highlighting the stability of the B(mida) group and the orthogonal nature of the B(pin) and B(mida) protecting groups under standard KHF2 conditions. Further , addition of Bu4NOH enabled isolation of the more soluble tetrabutylammonium triﬂuoroborate salt .	0
the phosphoramidite building block was completed by of standard removal of the silyl protecting groups ( → 9 ) followed by dimethoxytritylation ( → 10 ) and phosphitylation with 2- cyanoethyl diisopropylamino chlorophosphine ( CEP-Cl ) to give 11 in a respectable overall yield of 13.4 % starting from 1.

ABSTRACT : Dithianes are versatile umpolung intermediates in organic synthesis but have rarely been employed in radical cross-coupling reactions. Here we describe the oxidative coupling method for alkyne difunctionalization under metal- catalyst - free conditions. The eﬃcient protocol directly aﬀords a variety of β-ketodithianes in good to excellent yields with high regioselectivities. It provides a general pathway for accessing valuable dithianes with controlled formation of a new C − C bond and a C − O bond via a radical coupling pathway .	0

Article amines in 45 − 51 % yields ( Table 2 ). We also examined the eﬃcacy of unsubstituted 7-azaindole 1k in undergoing C3- alkylation under the above reaction conditions.

From the high yield obtained in the ﬁnal acetate - removal step ( Scheme 5 ) , it was clear that keto-carbinol 9 , unlike keto- ester 4 , was stable toward base , providing an advantage in ketone hydrogenation. Keto-carbinol 9 was screened against a range of hydrogenation catalysts ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ) under standard reaction conditions employing isopropanol as solvent and potassium tert-butoxide as base. Complete conversion was achieved with ﬁve catalysts , with the other three giving 50 % or higher conversion. Ketone 9 is sparingly soluble in isopropanol , and the reaction proceeds from a slurry to a solution. The complete conversion obtained with keto-carbinol 9 with [ ( (R)- Xyl-BINAP)((R)-DAIPEN)RuCl2 ] ( entry 5 ) contrasts with the 40 % conversion obtained with keto-ester 4 under these conditions. Three catalysts gave high enantiomeric excesses close to or surpassing 98 % , with two , [ ((R)-Xyl-BINAP)- ((R,R)-DPEN)RuCl2 ] ( entry 5 ) and [ ((R)-Xyl-SEGPHPOS)- ((R)-DAIPEN)RuCl2 ] ( entry 8 ) , giving over 98.5 % enantio- meric excess.

Chiral phosphoric acids ( CPAs ) belong to a class of privileged organocatalysts , which have enabled a variety of enantioselective transformations.6 Moreover , 2-vinylindoles have recently been utilized as dienes to participate in a number of catalytic asymmetric Diels − Alder reactions or formal [ 4 + 2 ] cycloadditions.7 However , this diene species has never been employed to the Diels − Alder reactions with methyleneindoli- nones8 to construct a spiro[tetrahydrocarbazole-3,3′-oxindole] motif. On the basis of our previous works on CPA - catalyzed enantioselective reactions,9 we envisioned that 2-vinylindoles and methyleneindolinones could be simultaneously activated by CPA via dual hydrogen - bonding activation to undergo stereoselective Diels − Alder reaction / isomerization , thus con- structing the desired enantioenriched spiro[tetrahydro- carbazole-3,3′-oxindole ] framework in a single transformation ( Scheme 3 ). Herein , we report the CPA - catalyzed asymmetric Diels− Alder reactions of 2-vinylindoles with methyleneindolinones , which eﬃciently construct the chiral spiro[tetrahydrocarbazole- 3,3′-oxindole ] architecture with three contiguous stereogenic centers in excellent stereoselectivities ( up to > 95 : 5 dr , 97 % ee ). ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Initially , the reaction of 2-vinylindole 1a and methyleneindo- linone 2a catalyzed by 10 mol % of CPA 4a in toluene at 50 ° C was employed to testify our hypothesis ( Table 1 , entry 1 ) , which smoothly underwent the Diels − Alder reaction to aﬀord the desired spiro[tetrahydrocarbazole-3,3′-oxindole] 3aa in a high yield of 80 % and a considerable stereoselectivity of > 95 : 5 dr and 72 % ee. Then , this reaction was utilized as a model reaction to screen a variety of CPAs 4a−4g , which revealed that catalysts 4e and 4g with bulky 3,3′-substituents on the BINOL backbone delivered the highest enantioselectivity of 94 % ee ( entries 5 and 7 ).

detail below , this data combined with the temperature studies suggests the possibility that two diﬀerent reaction mechanisms are operating to produce the two products. Irradiating styrene− yne 30 at 180 ° C in DCE either under air or after degassing the reaction mixture with argon both generated a 1.9 : 1 mixture of dihydronaphthalene 31b to naphthalene 31a in as little as 2 min ( see Table S1 ( Supporting Information ) for a complete listing of experimental conditions employed ). While these conditions did not ensure rigorous exclusion of oxygen , this experiment indicates that performing the reaction in the presence or absence of oxygen has no eﬀect on the product selectivity or the rate of reaction for the time scale that was measured. This data strongly suggests that molecular oxygen is not functioning as an adventitious oxidant of dihydronaph- thalene 31b to naphthalene 31a. These thought - provoking results support the need for a more thorough understanding of the mechanism of product formation in this reaction prior to embarking on further scope and limitation studies. A discussion of the results from these mechanistic investigations is provided herein .	0
Inspection of models indicated that a bisubstrate analogue where the IPP and DMAPP fragments were joined by a bond between the Z-methyl group in DMAPP and the methyl group in IPP could fold to a position in which C4 in the IPP fragment is in a plane above C1 in the DMAPP fragment , resulting in an orientation compatible with electrophilic alkylation of the “ C3− C4 ” double bond in the IPP fragment ( Figure 1 ). We synthesized analogues 3-OPP and 4-OPP as bisubstrate mimics of IPP / DMAPP and IPP / GPP and now report kinetic and product studies that conﬁrm their compatibility with the active site of avian FPPase .	0
We therefore applied DFT modeling and NCI analysis ( ωB97XD / TZVP / SCRF = chloroform)15 to compare small energy diﬀerences between structures and the corresponding populations of compounds 1 and 4 ( Figure 3 ). This model predicts that the amide lone pair in the Z-conﬁguration is not in the correct orientation to participate in an n − π* aryl interaction. Compound 1 exhibits four potential conformations , corre- sponding to two potential amide rotamers and the two piperidine ring - ﬂipped conformations ( cf. Web - enhanced table ). Comparison of the relative energy of these conforma- tions of 1 reveals that the Z-amide isomer is lower in free energy than the E-amide ( Table S1 ). The Boltzmann population distribution of the four energy minima indicates only signiﬁcant population of the E- and Z-ground-state conformers in a 16 : 84 E : Z ratio , in good agreement with observed values ( Tables S1 and S2 ). Prediction of the 1H NMR chemical shifts for Z-1 provided resonances of the acetyl methyl protons at an average value of 2.01 ppm and for the equatorial H4 proton at 3.57 ppm , in good agreement with NOE results ( Table S3 , Figure 2B ). The predicted shifts for E-1 gave the methyl protons at an averaged resonance of 2.36 ppm and H6 at 6.09 ppm , also in excellent agreement with experimental data ( Table S4 , Figure 2B ) .	0
Intramolecular additions of carbon radicals onto alkenes are very important reactions in organic synthesis. The eﬃciency of these reactions depends on their rate , which in turn is subject to the type of substituents on the radical and on the alkene. Thus , Michael - type radical conjugate additions , in which a nucleo- philic radical is added to an alkene or an alkyne attached to an electron - withdrawing group ( EWG ) , are among the most eﬃcient radical cyclizations ( Scheme 1 ). 1	0

ABSTRACT : Enyne cross metathesis of propargylamines with ethyl vinyl ether enables the one - pot synthesis of substituted pyrroles. A series of substituted pyrroles , bearing alkyl , aryl , and heteroaryl substituents , has been synthesized in good yields under microwave irradiation. The reactions are rapid and procedurally simple and also represent a facile entry to the synthetically challenging 1,2,3-substituted pyrroles. The value of the method- ology is further corroborated by the conversion of pyrroles into 3- methyl-pyrrolines and the derivatization of the 3-methyl-substituent arising from the metathesis reaction .	0

A rather less developed approach is the replacement of the phenolic units of a calixarene against ﬂuorogenic moieties , which so far had only been shown for a complete exchange in the case of the calixnaphthalenes.12 To the best of our knowledge , the replacement of only one of the phenolic units of a calixarene has not been explored yet , though the combination of conformational ﬂexibility on the one hand and rigidity on the other seems a rather auspicious concept ( Scheme 1 ). By inserting a condensed aromatic system , the resulting receptor is envisaged to enable better C − H···π and cation···π interactions with a methylammonium ion guest and at the same time allow an eﬃcient quantiﬁcation of host / guest interactions .	0
furo- tropne 3q were also recorded in diﬀerent solvents at 10 μM concentration and the results are summarized in Figure 3b and Table 2. Fluorescence emission patterns were found to be strongly solvent dependent. Solvent eﬀect was more pronounced in n − π* transition when excited the molecule at 340 nm. Interestingly , maximum Stokes shift ( 97 nm ) was observed in DMSO and also in ethanol ( 94 nm ) while minimum Stokes shift was realized in acetone ( 41 nm ).

ammonia ( 3 ) ( 26 % , 1.5 mL ) with CuI ( 0.05 mmol ) in DMF ( 3 mL ) at 80 ° C for 24 h gave 2-phenyl-1H-indole-3-carbonitrile ( 4a ) in 15 % yield and 2,4-diphenyl-9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indole ( 5a ) in 21 % yield ( Table 1 , entry 1 ). To improve the eﬃciency , several ligands including 1,10-phenanthroline ( 1,10-phen ) , L- proline , and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane ( DABCO ) were tried ( entries 2 − 4 ). Among them , DABCO showed a positive eﬀect in raising the yields of both 4a and 5a ( entry 4 ). Next , inspired by the fact that pivalic acid ( PivOH ) has frequently been used as an additive to facilitate Cu - catalyzed coupling reactions,17 we tried PivOH in the reaction of 1a , 2a , and 3. As expected , addition of PivOH did indeed improve the reaction , but the yields were still not satisfactory ( entry 5 ). Gratifyingly , using a combination of DABCO ( 0.2 equiv ) with PivOH ( 1 equiv ) gave better yields of both 4a and 5a than using DABCO or PivOH alone , although the selectivity was only marginal ( entry 6 ). In following studies , we were pleased to ﬁnd that in the presence of CuI ( 0.1 equiv ) , DABCO ( 0.2 equiv ) , and PivOH ( 1 equiv ) , reducing the amount of solvent ( DMF ) ampliﬁed the selectivity for 4a signiﬁcantly ( entry 7 ) , and 1.5 mL of DMF was found to be the most optimal ( entry 8 ; concentration of ammonia ≈ 7 M , 1a:2a : 3 molar ratio = 1 : 2 : 42 ; condition A ). Notably , when the other conditions were kept unchanged , halving the amounts of both aqueous ammonia 3 and DMF ( concentration of ammonia ≈ 7 M , 1a:2a : 3 molar ratio = 1 : 2 : 21 ) resulted in reduced yield and selectivity ( entry 9 ). On the other hand , doubling the amounts of both 3 and DMF ( concentration of ammonia ≈ 7 M , 1a:2a : 3 molar ratio = 1 : 2 : 84 ) did not improve the reaction further ( entry 10 ). Next , other solvents such as DMSO and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone ( NMP ) were screened , and they were less eﬀective than DMF in mediating this reaction ( entries 11 and 12 ).

■ INTRODUCTION Azide - mediated coupling reactions have a long history , dating back to Curtius ’ acyl azide - based amide coupling in the early 20th century,1 and have regained intense interest after the introduction of Staudinger ligation2 and metal - catalyzed azide− alkyne cycloaddition ( CuAAC / RuAAC ). 3 These “ click - type ” coupling reactions exhibit excellent chemoselectivity and have been employed in many applications , including surface functionalization and bioconjugation.4 The use of metal catalysts , however , the corresponding coupling reactions for biological applications due to the concerns of cytotoxicity. A strategy to eliminate the catalyst involves preactivation of the reagents , by using , for example , strained alkynes in the reaction.5 Coupling reactions that involve activated azides are less studied.6 One example involves the thioacid / azide amidation reaction , ﬁrst discovered in the 1980s,7 and reinvestigated in the past decade.8 Various azides can react with thiocarboxylic acids ( −CSOH or −COSH ) to form amide bonds while releasing nitrogen gas and elemental sulfur. Azides having electron - withdrawing groups generally display kinetics considerably faster than those of their electron- rich counterparts. This is in contrast to Staudinger ligation and azide − alkyne cycloaddition , where electron - rich azides show higher the thioacid-azide reaction has been proposed to proceed by stepwise nucleophilic addition to give intermediate I , followed by cyclization to thiotriazoline intermediate ( II ) , and ﬁnal extrusion of N2S to give the amide product ( Scheme 1 ). 8b	0
In contrast , ATH of short - chain aliphatic β-ketoesters catalyzed by catalyst 2 only provided poor enantioselectivity ( e.g. , 31 % ee for 32a , Figure 6 ). It implied that the CH − π interaction between the Cp* group of the catalyst and the ester function of the β-substrate is too weak to stabilize the transition state , thus leading to poor enantioselectivity for short - chain aliphatic substrates. However , the strong hydrophobic inter- action between the long alkyl chain of the substrate and the aliphatic tail of the catalyst in the metallomicelle core may greatly improve the stability of the catalytic transition state ( Figure 5 ) , resulting in high enantioselectivities in thus long - chain aliphatic β-ketoesters ( 86 − 91 % ee , reduction of Table 2 , entry 9 − 12 ). It is also consistent with the observation that poor enantioselectivity ( 11 % ee , Table 2 , entry 13 ) was obtained for long - chain aliphatic β-ketoester substrates using Rh - TsDPEN catalyst due to lack of strong hydrophobic attraction in the transition state. In the case of aliphatic γ- ketoesters , we propose that the aliphatic γ-ketoesters may have the same mechanism as β-ketoesters. We also investigated the mechanism of aliphatic ketoesters bearing acetyl ketone group ( 21−29a ). We propose that the absolute conﬁgurations was controlled with a similar mecha- nism as that of aliphatic ketones ( SI Figure S8),10b but the ester group of the substrate may have some interaction with the catalyst playing a negative role on the transition state , which could be explained by the phenomena that decreasing the space of to lower enantioselectivity ( Table 3 entries 1 − 5 ). On the other hand , the reason for high enantioselectivity of product is explained by the fact that strong hydrophobic interaction between the chain of the catalyst and the alkyl chain of the substrate may stabilize the transition state .	0

and display a strong positive and negative CD band ( β band ) around 300 − 340 nm for (+)-3b , and (−)-3b , respectively. Since it is commonly accepted that the sign of the most intense CD band ( β band ) is the absolute conﬁguration of the helicene , with a positive ( negative ) band corresponding to P ( M ) helicity , the P helicity can be attributed to the enantiomer (+)-3b and vice versa for (−)-3b , in perfect agreement with the results obtained from X-ray studies .	0
photoisomerization , we measured the reaction quantum yield for 3 and 7 as representative examples. Using trans − azobenzene as an actinometer50 and measuring the conversion of the E to Z isomer at short times , we obtained a Φ of 15 ± 1 % for irradiation at 334 nm for 3 and 16 ± 1 % for 7. Although these values are not as high as some recently reported,44 they do conﬁrm that this new family of compounds is quite eﬃcient and promising .	0

As outlined in Scheme 5 , we have also explored the reactions of phenyl disulﬁde 2a with several kinds of quinones. Adding an electron - donating group at the 3-position of 1,4-naphtho- quinone ( 1a ) , such as an alkyl substituent , aﬀords the thioether ( 3m ) with improved yield. Whereas adding a phenyl group at the 3-position does not show much inﬂuence on the reaction ( 3n ). However , if the substrates bearing an electron-with- drawing substituent at the 2- or 4-position of the phenyl ring are used , the reaction yields are signiﬁcantly reduced ( 3o and 3q ). The presence of an electron - withdrawing substituent at the 3-position on the phenyl ring does not show much inﬂuence on the yield of the corresponding thioether ( 3p ). In contrast , the phenyl group which is bearing an electron - donating substituent	0
The observed antifungal activities of FG03 led to the designs of other kanamycin derivatives with 6″-OH and the second- stage SAR investigation. In this stage , we planned to determine if octylation at other hydroxyl groups will enable the antibacterial to antifungal conversion ( Figure 2 ). The design for FG05 is two-carbon shorter than FG06 since the position of alkylation is O-6″ , which is considered extended as compared to the octyl group at O-4″ position ( FG03 ). The designs of FG10 and FG11 were intended to help understand the role of 3″- NH2 as well as the eﬀect of the octyl group at the O-5 position.

the energy proﬁles for the conversion of A to B , along with the calculated bond lengths of the O − C60 and amino N − C60 in each species. In addition to A and B , the calculations have located two transition states TS1 and TS2 and an intermediate state INT1. Small activation barriers of 7.5 and 9.9 kcal / mol are predicted for the migration of the O − C60 and amino N − C60 bonds from the [6,6] - bond to the [5,6] - bond , respectively. The calculations also predict B is more energetically favorable over A by 6.3 and 6.7 kcal / mol for oxazoline and imidazoline , respectively , consistent with the experimentally observed conversion of A to B. The variations of the O − C60 and amino N − C60 bond lengths in A , TS1 , INT1 , TS2 , and B are in good agreement with cleavage and formation of the X − C60 bond during the relocation of the heteroatom , where the X − C2 bond is broken in TS1 , and the X − C9 bond is formed in TS2 by migrating the O or amino N atom from C2 to C9 via INT1. On the basis of the discussion above , a reaction mechanism for the formation of 3 and 4 via the reductive benzylation of 1 and 2 is proposed and illustrated in Scheme 1.

Control experiments were conducted to verify the reaction the presumed C → N silyl mechanism. To conﬁrm that migration actually occurred , we quenched the reaction with aqueous NaHCO3 rather than 1 N HCl solution and obtained the N-silyl diamine 4a ( eq 1 ). To rule out the possibility that the coupling reaction was initiated by deprotonation at the α- position of the α-silylamine , we labeled N-phenyl α-silylamine with deuterium on the α-carbon ( d-1a ) and coupled it to the imine 2a to aﬀord the vicinal diamine d-3a or the N-silyl diamine d-4a with the deuterium intact ( eq 3 ). Coupling 1a and 2a in the presence of CsF was examined,40 and predominantly benzylamine 5 formed ; the coupling product 3a was obtained in low yield ( 24 % ) with poor diastereocontrol ( 1.2 : 1 dr ) showing syn selectivity ( eq 4 ).

These deprotection reaction conditions are also compatible with other sulfoximine substrates.22	0

that the allylation with allylstannes requires Lewis acid ( e.g. , BF3 ) catalysts , while the reaction with allylboronate proceeds without catalysts. The regio- and stereochemistry16 of the Lewis acid - catalyzed process of allyl-stannanes of carbonyls is determined by a Type II ( open ) TS , while the allylation by allylboronates is determined by a Type I ( six - membered ring ) TS ( see below the mechanistic rationalization of the reaction ). Farnesyl-Bpin 2c also reacted easily with 1a to give natural product , farnesyl-BQ 3c. Interestingly , Baran and co-workers7b reported a sluggish reactivity for the AgNO3 - catalyzed process using K2S2O8 as oxidant in CH2Cl2 / water ( 1 : 1 ) mixture. Under our conditions , using 1a as oxidant without any catalyst in chloroform the reaction gives 3c smoothly. Baran and co- workers employed farnesyl-BF3K instead of farnesyl-Bpin 2c and obtained 3c with essentially the same E / Z selectivity as we did ( entry 3 ) but in somewhat lower yield.

Transition - metal - catalyzed decarboxylative coupling reactions have attracted much attention in the past decade due to their potential advantages , such as high selectivity , eﬃciency , and convenience as well as the nontoxic byproduct ( CO2 ). Thus far , notable progress has been made in the area of decarboxylative couplings for various C − C bond and C − heteroatom bond forming reactions.1 However , examples involving a decarbox- ylative coupling reaction between carboxylic acids remain much underdeveloped : 2 almost all of these reactions are restricted to Pd - catalyzed decarboxylative hetero- or homocouplings be- tween aromatic carboxylic acids. Herein , we report the ﬁrst example of a decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction between α-oxocarboxylic acids and acrylic acids to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds facilitated by an iron catalyst through the extrusion of two molecules of CO2 in aqueous media ( Scheme 1 ) .	0

Also described are the results of a study of enantioselective spirocyclization of propargyl carbonates with oxindole and indole substrates in the presence of chiral phosphine ligands .	0
examined to test the scope and limitation of this cascade reaction ; the results are summarized in Table 2. In most cases , the desired β-alkynyl ketones were smoothly generated in good to excellent yields. Both acetylacetone ( 2a ) and benzoylacetone ( 2b ) were found to yield the desired products , with the former providing relatively higher yields of the products. Among the various N-cyclohexyl propargylamines 1 that were examined , electron - donating R1 groups ( −CH3 ) resulted in higher yields than when R1 was an electron - withdrawing group ( −Cl , −Br ) ( Table 2 , entries 6 , 7 , 17 , 18 ). The reaction was aﬀected signiﬁcantly by the steric eﬀect. No product was detected with a tert-butyl group at the ortho and para positions of the hydroxyl of N-cyclohexyl propargylamines ( 1m ) ( Table 2 , entries 10 , 23 ). The structure of product 3j was unambiguously conﬁrmed by the X-ray crystallographic analysis , as shown in Figure 1 in the Supporting Information .	0

Utilizing brine as the solvent , the product was obtained in quantitative yield and excellent selectivities in shorter reaction time ( entry 2 , Table 1 ). Using only 2.5 mol % catalyst loading , a number of solvents were tested , proving that brine aﬀorded the best results ( entries 3 − 10 , Table 1 ). A variety of acid additives were then tested , none of which led to better results ( entries 11 − 15 , Table 1 ). After identifying the optimum reaction medium for catalyst 2 , catalysts 1 and 3 − 5 were also tested ( Table 2 and Supporting Information ). As mentioned before , a clear diﬀerence with our ﬁrst generation catalyst 1 was the diﬀerent reaction medium ( organic solvents for 1 , but brine for 2 ). Catalyst 1 worked in THF , but in brine aﬀorded only traces of the product. In sharp contrast , catalyst 2 aﬀorded the product in excellent yield in brine ( entries 1 and 2 vs entries 3− 5 ). Another key aspect was the reagent ratio , since 1 worked only at 10 : 1 ratio. Catalyst 2 worked equally well at lower reagent ratios ( entries 3 − 5 , Table 2 ). 14 We were happy to ﬁnd out even at almost stoichiometric ratios ( 1.1 : 1 ) , catalyst 2 performed equally well ( entry 5 , Table 2 ). Thus , we were able to establish a green protocol , where a low catalyst loading of 5 mol % could catalyze eﬃciently the Michael reaction between cyclohexanone and nitrostyrene ( in a stoichiometric ratio ) in brine. After the completion of the reaction , the product is just extracted from the reaction mixture and no further puriﬁcation is required.

ABSTRACT : Tetrahydro[60]fullerene epoxides C60(O)- Arn(NR2)4−n , n = 1 , 2 , have been prepared by treating 1,4- adducts C60(OH)Ph and C60(Tol)2 with cyclic secondary amines. The epoxy moieties in these mixed tetrahydro[60]- fullerene epoxides were hydrolyzed into the corresponding diol derivatives , which were further oxidized into diketone open - cage fullerenes with a 10-membered oriﬁce. A few other reactions also showed that the present tetrahydro[60]fullerene epoxides with both amino and aryl addends exhibit improved chemical reactivity over the tetraamino[60]fullerene epoxide without any aryl group .	0

considerablely aﬀects their movement in these dendritic molecules. The short T1 of these dendrons and the dendrimer indicated that the mobility of ﬂuorines in the dendrimer is very high. It is noteworthy that these dendritic molecules have signiﬁcantly shorter relaxation times than those of 19F MRI agents reported so far.5,6,8,10,11 As a control , triﬂuoroethanol ( CF3CH2OH ) under the same conditions gave a considerably longer T1 of 2379 ms and T2 of 267 ms. From a sensitivity point of view , shorter relaxation times dramatically enhance the 19F MRI signal by allowing the collection of more transient signals without prolonging the data acquisition time .	0

More recently an N-alkyl triazolium catalyst was modeled for the homocoupling of benzaldehyde.21 The study determined that the rate - limiting step was most likely formation of the Breslow intermediate ( ΔG = 28.8 − 30.9 kcal / mol ) using the B3LYP functional with the 6-31+G(d) and 6-311+G(2d,p) basis sets. However , the possibility of a stepwise proton transfer mediated by the base / conjugate acid was not explored. The attacks on aldehydes ( [II-III] and [V-VI] ) were found to be the second highest barriers at 24.1 and 27.0 kcal / mol , respectively. the Nyulászi group recently reported a study comparing benzoin reactions as catalyzed by thiazolium and triazolium catalysts.22 While Gibbs free energies were not determined , self - consistent ﬁeld ( SCF ) energies at the B3LYP / 6- 311+G** level were shown. The authors note that NHC− aldehyde adducts are signiﬁcantly lower in energy than the Breslow intermediate , though only the energy of the Berkessel adduct ( the keto tautomer of the Breslow intermediate)23 was calculated. Again the rate - limiting step was found to be the proton transfer leading to the Breslow intermediate , though the authors suggest that this could change in a stepwise base- mediated scenario. Although not the focus of the report , the study also found that the barrier for the carbon − carbon bond formation step ( [V-VI] ) with acetaldehyde and its triazolium- derived Breslow intermediate is 3.5 kcal / mol higher in energy than the ejection ( [VI-I] ) step. This is reversed in the same steps with the thiazolium - derived Breslow intermediate ; the ejection step is 2.9 kcal / mol higher in energy than the carbon − carbon bond forming step .	0

counteract the eﬀect of the inhibition , larger amounts of the enzyme were used , which indeed gave a higher ﬁnal ee of the product. A reaction in preparative scale gave the product with a ﬁnal ee of 86 % . The addition of an additional portion of CALB to the reaction mixture , thereby allowing the enzyme to hydrolyze the remaining minor enantiomer , gave after puriﬁcation the product (R)-9 in 69 % yield and with 98 % ee. The next step in the synthesis was the reaction of (R)-9 with the aniline derivative 13. This aniline was eﬃciently synthesized according to a slightly modiﬁed literature procedure consisting of a one - pot two - step reaction using Pd / C as a catalyst for both the Suzuki coupling between 10 and 11 and hydrogenation of the nitro group ( Scheme 7 ). 21 The substitution gave product (R)-14 in high yield and practically without any racemization. The drawback with this reaction is the need to use 3 equiv of the aniline derivative 13 ; however , most of the remaining compound was possible to recover from the chromatographic puriﬁcation. In the catalytic hydrogenation to obtain amino alcohol (R)-15 , using conditions identical to those used for the other substrates , only a slight decrease in enantiomeric excess was observed ( 97 % to 94 % ). In order to reduce the amide to an amine without reducing the ester functionality , we used a modiﬁed literature procedure employing borane dimethylsul- ﬁde complex ; 22 this transformation gave the known compound (R)-16 with an enantiomeric excess of 95 % . Final hydrolysis of the ester function to the carboxylic acid was accomplished following a literature procedure using LiOH.3 The absolute conﬁguration of 2 was conﬁrmed to be R by comparing the sign of the optical rotation with that previously reported.9,23	0

ABSTRACT : Dynamic NMR spectroscopy has been used to measure rotation barriers in ﬁve B,B - disubstituted 1,3-dimethyli- midazol-2-ylidene boranes. The barriers are attributed to the sp2− sp3 bond between C(1) of the N - heterocyclic carbene ring and the boron atom. Bonds to boron atoms bearing a thexyl ( 1,1,2- trimethylpropyl ) group show especially high barriers , ranging from 75 − 86 kJ mol−1. 2-Isopropyl-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene is used as a comparable to help understand the nature and magnitude of the barriers .	0
ABSTRACT : A formal insertion of two aryne moieties into the carbon − oxygen double bond of cyclopropenone has been realized. Spirocyclic xanthene − cyclopropene scaﬀolds were obtained. Mechanistically , a sequence of a formal [ 2 + 2]- cycloaddition followed by electrocyclic ring opening and a terminating [ 4 + 2 ] - type cycloaddition is postulated. The use of an electron - rich aryne precursor led to ring cleavage of the cyclopropene to aﬀord an unprecedented xanthylium salt .	0
ABSTRACT : A one - step protocol has been developed for the enantioselective synthesis of hexahydrodibenzofuran derivatives using a modiﬁed Friedel − Crafts reaction. The developed method was applied to the synthesis of a series of natural products including (+)-hostmanin A , (+)-methyllinderatin , and (−)-linderol A. The synthetic and spectroscopic data investigations led to the structural reassignment of natural product adunctin E , which was further conﬁrmed by single - crystal X-ray analysis .	0
isocyanides to D-arabino-imine obtained from lactam 3 resulted in the formation of 2,3-trans - substituted piperidine derivatives as the major products ( 15 − 17 ). The observed stereochemical course of the addition is similar to the outcome observed for the addition of Danishefsky ’s diene to the same imine20 but is opposite to the result of its C-allylation with allyltributylstannane.23 This result again conﬁrms our previous assumptions that the course of the addition to cyclic imines is ruled not only by stereoelectronic and steric factors resulting from the structure of the imine but depends also on the structure of the nucleophile.20 ■ CONCLUSIONS	0
ABSTRACT : We studied electronic change in oligothio- phenes by employing o-carborane into a molecular array in which one or both end ( s ) were substituted by electron- withdrawing dicyano-vinyl group(s ). Depending on mono- or bis-substitution at the o-carborane , a series of linear A1-D-A2 ( 1a−1c ) or V-shaped A1-D-A2-D-A1 ( 2a−2c ) oligothiophene chain structures of variable length were prepared ; A1 , D , and A2 , represent dicyano-vinyl , oligothiophenyl , and o-carboranyl groups , respectively. Among this series , 2a shows strong electron - acceptor capability of o-carborane comparable to that of the dicyano-vinyl substituent , which can be elaborated by a conformational eﬀect driven by cage σ*−π* interaction. As a result , electronic communications between o-carborane and dicyano-vinyl groups are successfully achieved in 2a .	0
clustering dendrograms for the predicted rat ntSI and ctSI obtained from these results. As shown in Figure 2 , we found that the number of representative structures for rat ctSI ( sucrase ) was larger than for rat ntSI ( isomaltase ) when we focused on the same criterion shown by the red dashed line. This fact suggests that the ﬂexibility around the keyhole of sucrase is greater than that of isomaltase. Thus , to consider the diﬀerence of keyhole ﬂexibility between isomaltase and sucrase , we have used the one and seven representative keyhole structures selected above with the same criteria in each docking calculation , respectively .	0

Retro- synthetically , the enone system of (+)-antroquinonol ( 1 ) can be achieved through the selenylation and oxidation protocols of the corresponding ketone7b available from precursor 5 ( Scheme 1 ). A sesquiterpene side chain of 5 could , in turn , be synthesized using Suzuki − Miyaura cross-coupling between the corresponding vinyl iodide and boronate available from iodo 6. The syn conﬁguration between C4 and C5 could be generated through the 6-exo-digonal radical cyclization of a cyclic radical generated from 8 by the Barton − McCombie deoxygenation.8	0

ABSTRACT : This paper demonstrates the role of solvent in selectivity and sensitivity of a series of electron - rich compounds for the detection of trace amounts of picric acid. Two new electron - rich ﬂuorescent esters ( 6 , 7 ) containing a triphenylamine backbone as well as their analogous carboxylic acids ( 8 , 9 ) have been synthesized and characterized. Fluorescent triphenylamine coupled with an ethynyl moiety constitutes π-electron - rich selective and sensitive probes for electron - deﬁcient picric acid ( PA ). the high sensitivity of all the sensors toward PA can be attributed to a combined eﬀect of the ground - state charge - transfer complex formation and resonance energy transfer between the sensor and analyte. The acids 8 and 9 also showed enhanced sensitivity for nitroaromatics in the solid state , and their enhanced sensitivity could be attributed to exciton migration due to close proximity of the neighboring acid molecules , as evident from the X-ray diﬀraction study. The compounds were found to be quite sensitive for the detection of trace amount of nitroaromatics in solution , solid , and contact mode .	0
The rapid increase in multidrug resistant bacterial and fungal infections in recent years has led to an urgent need for the development of new antimicrobial agents.1−5 Naturally occurring cyclic lipo(depsi)peptides are promising lead structures for antimicrobial drug discovery , with a number of compounds from this class such as daptomycin already in clinical use. Strains of Paenibacillus and Bacillus are known producers of bioactive cyclic lipopeptides , and a number of including the iturins,6 antimicrobial compound classes surfactins7,8 and fusaricidins ( or LI-F class)9,10 have been isolated from these microorganisms.11 These compounds are often produced as mixtures of closely related structures , and diﬀerent strains of microorganism can sometimes produce structures of high similarity. For example , the fusaricidin class of cyclic lipodespipeptides , which contain a cyclic depsihexapep- tide core with a 15-guanidino-3-hydroxypentadecanoyl ( GHPD ) side chain attached to the cycle via the nitrogen atom of an L-threonine residue , are obtained as a mixture of at least 12 compounds from the L-1129 strain of Paenibacillus polymyxa9,10 as well as from other strains of Paenibacillus.12,13 The components of this mixture diﬀer only in the compositions of three of the amino acids ( L-Thr , D-allo-Thr and D-Ala are conserved ) in the cyclic depsipeptide core , while the GHPD side chain remains constant the series. The promising antimicrobial activity displayed by the fusaricidin cyclic peptides against both fungi and bacteria ( including some drug resistant strains ) has led to the synthesis and evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a number of analogues of these compounds , the guanidino	0
We next studied the inﬂuence of the alkyne partner in the catalytic benzannulation reaction of 2-phenylpropionaldehyde 1 ( Scheme 4 ).

In the related aryl− alkyl alkyne family , substitution of the aromatic ring was examined. The reaction of 4-chloro- , 4-bromo- , and 4-methyl- substituted alkynes 6d − f aﬀorded the desired products 7d − f with comparable good results ( 62 − 69 % yield ). Diaryl- substituted alkynes were also prone to react under these mild catalytic conditions. In these cases , longer reaction times were needed and a reversed aldehyde / alkyne ratio was found to be successful to easily separate the desired product from the starting alkyne. The benzannulation of symmetrical alkynes 6g and 6h led to naphthalenes 7g and 7h in 46 % and 49 % yield , respectively. The eﬀectiveness of this catalytic reaction was further demonstrated by reacting 4-phenyl-but-3-yn-2-one 6i , which aﬀorded the corresponding 2-acetyl-substituted naph- thalene 7i in moderate 46 % isolated yield.

The eﬀectiveness of this catalytic reaction was further demonstrated by reacting 4-phenyl-but-3-yn-2-one 6i , which aﬀorded the corresponding 2-acetyl-substituted naph- thalene 7i in moderate 46 % isolated yield. To the best of our knowledge , this represents the ﬁrst example based on the use of an alkyne deactivated by an electron - withdrawing group in related aldehyde − alkyne benzannulation processes.

We found that a signiﬁcant amount of byproducts with polarity similar to that of C60 was always concurrently formed , although the desired fullerene - fused dioxane 2a was obtained in 17 % isolated yield ( entry 1 , Table 1 ).

Several control experiments were further performed to gain an insight into the reaction mechanism. The results are shown in Scheme 3. Accordingly , when N-methyl-N,3-diphenylpro- piolamide 1a was performed dependently under the standard conditions , azaspiro[4,5]trienone A could not form ( eq 2 , Scheme 3 ). This result indicated that azaspiro[4,5]trienone A might not be the key intermediate in this reaction. Moreover , the oxidative spirocyclization reaction was completely inhibited when 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy ( TEMPO , a well- known radical scavenger ) was added into the present reaction system , suggesting the reaction presumably underwent a radical pathway ( eq 3 , Scheme 3 ). Further investigation found that the model reaction could be extremely inhibited when 4 Å MS was introduced into the reaction system ( eq 4 , Scheme 3 ). Also , 18O atom could be incorporated in the corresponding spiro[4,5]trienone 3a when the reaction of 1a with 2a was 18O ( eq 5 , Scheme 3 ). These performed in the presence of H2 results clearly demonstrated that the carbonyl oxygen atom came from water. In addition , the intermolecular kinetic isotope eﬀect ( KIE ) experiment was observed with kH / kD = 1.0 , which indicated that C − H bond cleavage might not be the rate- determining step in the present transformation ( eq 6 , Scheme 3 ). the above results and previous reports,6,7,12−17 a possible reaction pathway was proposed and described in Scheme 4. Initially , the single - electron oxidation of sulfonylhydrazide 2 mediated by I2O5 would form sulfonyl radical 4 and I2. The generation of molecular iodine could be conﬁrmed by observation of an obvious color change from reddish brown to deep blue when starch was added into the present reaction system.16 Next , the selective addition of sulfonyl radical 4 to arylpropiolamide 1 gave the vinyl radical 5. Furthermore , intramolecular spiro - cyclization of vinyl radical 5 with an aryl ring generated the radical intermediate 6 , which produced the corresponding cyclohexadienyl cation 7 via a single - electron - transfer process.17 Subsequently , the nucleo- philic attack of H2O to cation 7 aﬀorded intermediate 8 , which was detected by LC − MS ( see Supporting Information ). 18 Finally , oxidation of intermediate 8 by TBHP would lead to the formation of the desired sulfonated azaspiro[4,5]trienone 3 .	0

Several control experiments were further performed to gain an insight into the reaction mechanism. The results are shown in Scheme 3. Accordingly , when N-methyl-N,3-diphenylpro- piolamide 1a was performed dependently under the standard conditions , azaspiro[4,5]trienone A could not form ( eq 2 , Scheme 3 ). This result indicated that azaspiro[4,5]trienone A might not be the key intermediate in this reaction. Moreover , the oxidative spirocyclization reaction was completely inhibited when 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy ( TEMPO , a well- known radical scavenger ) was added into the present reaction system , suggesting the reaction presumably underwent a radical pathway ( eq 3 , Scheme 3 ).

further increases in enantioselectivity. However , the overall reaction concentration inﬂuenced the enantioselectivity. By reducing the [5a] to 0.08 M , 73 % ee of 8aa was achieved ( Table 2 , entry 2 ). Under these more dilute conditions , optimization of the base and Lewis acid revealed that the use of ·OEt2 resulted dicyclohexyl methyl amine ( Cy2NMe ) and BF3 in even higher enantioselectivity ( entries 3 − 4 ). At a reaction temperature to − 22 ° C , chromene 8aa was formed in 83 % ee , but at the cost of yield ( entry 5 ). Increasing the equivalents of ·OEt2 led to synthetically useful yields of chromene 8aa in BF3	0

Optimization Studies : Structure and Reactivity of the Intermediate Lactol 15. Considering our results in total so far , we still found it puzzling that an apparently tiny amount of acid impurity in the aldehyde substrate was suﬃcient to promote observable amounts of elimination product 26 , particularly when the commercial pH 7 Na / K buﬀer was utilized. Further consideration of the mechanistic pathway leading to elimination led us to question what intermediate was actually responsible for generation of the elimination product 26. Monitoring the reaction in toluene , we observed the presence of equilibrium between the open and closed forms , lactol 15 and hydroxy aldehyde 27 , in favor of the closed form 15 ( 15 : 27 ratio 3 : 1 ) as shown in Scheme 6. While monitoring the same reaction during the previously described solvent screen , we observed that the equilibrium between 15 to 27 shifted toward the open form aldehyde 27 in solvents that had in the α-hydroxymethylation reaction. not performed well	0

Amino acids and peptides are eﬀective building blocks for creating hierarchical nanomaterials3 and functionalized GNPs.4 They feature a multitude of functionalities and unique secondary structures based on controllable primary sequences and environmental conditions.5 By using amino acids and peptides , it is thus possible to tailor new hybrid materials for a broad range of applications in diﬀerent areas , such as medicine , bionanotechnology , and electrochemistry.6 Conversely , focus- ing on biomedical applications , peptide instability toward proteases might be a concern. Synthetic analogues of natural amino acids represent valuable tools for overcoming this the use of α,α-disubstituted problem.3b,7 derivatives gives the double advantage of reducing metabolic degradation and of stabilizing the helical conformation by reducing the available conformational space of the peptide backbone.8	0

The synthesis and an early evaluation of the hybridization properties of α-L-HNA [ (oligo)adenylates being preliminarily considered ] to natural and unnatural complements were carried out through studies in the mirror image world.29 Accordingly , in place of a direct evaluation of the hybridization potential of α-L-HNA by annealing experiments with D-oligonucleotides ( e.g. , D-DNA and D-RNA ) , we instead conceived to perform its mirror image ( α-D-HNA ) with hybridization studies of complementary sequences of L-oligonucleotides ( e.g. , commer- cially available L-DNA and L-RNA ). Exploiting the principles of chirality and enantiomeric recognition of nucleic acids , this evaluation was expected to indirectly provide information on the hybridization properties of our target α-L-HNA system. ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Nucleoside synthesis.

We also explored the reactivity of the Cu(acac)2 / FeCl3- catalyzed oxyphosphorylation system for larger - scale synthesis shown in Scheme 2. The reaction with ( 10 mmol , 1.02 g ) of phenylacetylene produced excellent yield ( 63 % ). The oxy- phosphorylation proceeded smoothly even with a further increased amount of substrate ( 50 mmol , 5.10 g ) , aﬀording β-ketophosphonates in 61 % yield. These excellent results showed the promise of the catalytic system for larger - scale synthesis in the process of alkyne oxyphosphorylation .	0
In order to determine whether the change in Gibbs free energy is positive for the RCM of terminal dioleﬁns aﬀording smaller than 12-membered cycles , irrespective of a scaﬀold fused to enediyne system , the corresponding reactions for four indole- and four benzannulated terminal dioleﬁns were also investigated by the DFT method. It was found that the replacement of a sulfur atom with nitrogen did not inﬂuence the reactivity of dioleﬁns in the RCM process ( Table 3 ). This reaction could be practically useful only for the synthesis of 12-	0
ABSTRACT : A new oxidizing system for oleﬁns , consisting of benzeneseleninic anhydride and trimethylsilyl triﬂate , was studied. The highly reactive benzeneseleninyl cation is presumably formed under It has been shown that diﬀerent products are formed with this species depending on the speciﬁc structure of oleﬁn. The 1,1- disubstituted oleﬁns aﬀorded mostly α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The sterically encumbered tri- or tetrasubstituted oleﬁns yielded 1,2- or 1,4-dihydroxylated products , presumably via four - membered cyclic intermediates .	0
Role of N2 and N9 in C1-Aryl-β-Carbolines As a Directing Group. In order to understand the role of N2 or N9 as a directing group in C1-aryl-β-carbolines , we have chosen a model substrate 13 (1-phenyl-9H-carbazole),17 which is devoid of N2. Suprisingly , 13 remains unreactive in the arylation conditions , even when aryl bromide were taken in large excess ( 5 equiv ) ( Scheme 3 ). Thus , this model study strongly suggests that N2 have greater role in arylation of C1-aryl-β-carbolines derivatives than N9. In addition , the cycloruthanted complex 2cr also supports the role of N2 as directing group over N9 .	0

Screening results revealed C. echinulata ( National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms ; catalogue no. 691 ) eﬃciently carried out biotransformation of epoxyazadiradione ( 1 ) , an isolated limonoid from Neem ( Azadirachta indica ) fruits.25 Highest conversion ( 91.5 % ) of the substrate was achieved by C. echinulata with formation of a single metabolite with 0.2 g / L substrate concentration ( 20 mg substrate in 100 mL fermentation medium ) and 4 days incubation period ( Supporting Information ; Table S1 ). The metabolite was found to be absent in substrate control ( i.e. , substrate without organism ) and organism control ( i.e. , organism without substrate ) experiments , thus indicating the transformation to be whole - cell catalyzed. A resting cell experiment also showed the formation of the same metabolite which further authenticated the whole - cell mediated transformation of epoxyazadiradione ( 1 ) ( Supporting Information ; Figure S1 ).

the arabinofuranosyl oxocarbenium ions 45 , 46 , and 47 ( R = H , Me , and Ph ) are displayed in Figure 6. The global FES maps indicate that all three ions preferentially adopt an 3E conformation. The individual C4−C5 rotamer maps reveal that the gg conformers are the most stable. The conformational preference of the arabinosyl oxocarbenium ions ( 45 − 47 ) is less profound than the preference of the corresponding ribo-oxocarbenium ions ( 42 − 44 ). This may be due to the fact that the C2 and C3 substituents can not simultaneously adopt their most favorable orientation in either of the envelope structures. As is the case of the ribofuranosyl oxocarbenium ions , the FES maps for the ion 46 are somewhat methyl-substituted arabinofuranosyl steeper than for the aldose ion 45 , while the maps for the phenyl-substituted arabinofuranosyl ion 47 are somewhat less steep. The global FES maps of ions 45 − 47 do not show a distinct two conformer model ; instead they show a gradual increase in energy for the conformers around the 3E − E3 axis ( 18 − 198 ° ). On the basis of the ﬂattened FES of the phenyl ketose oxocarbenium ion 47 , one predicts an erosion of stereoselectivity in reactions involving this species. This is conﬁrmed in the experiments : the arabino aldose and methyl ketofuranose both provide a single product upon reduction , whereas arabino phenyl ketofuranose gives an anomeric mixture	0
sesterterpenes with a cheilantane skeleton ( Scheme 1 ). With all of these considerations , a biogenetic sequence for the biosynthesis of salmahyrtisanes can be planned , as depicted in Scheme 1. Previously , we reported the synthesis of hyrtiosal ( 4 ) from (−)-sclareol.12,13 With this in hand , we planned a biomimetic route toward salmahyrtisanes from hyrtiosanes. For the tetracarbocyclic skeleton , we envisioned two diﬀerent strategies ( Scheme 2 ). In the ﬁrst one , we considered the cyclization of intermediate I by means of a “ Prins - type reaction ” . An alternative is the Friedel − Craft reaction of intermediate II .	0
Similar analyses of the relationship between computed and experimental 1H NMR chemical shifts are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in the Supporting Information ( Figures S3 and S4 ). The DFT - computed 15N NMR chemical shift for 6a is δ ≈ − 288 ppm , which is within 1 ppm of the experimental value for 6 and within the typical range for NH groups in similar diamines ( Table S2 , Supporting Information ). 14,15	0
The equilibration results indicate that the energy diﬀerence between each pair of epimeric p - substituted 2,2-diaryl-cis-4,6- dimethyl-1,3-dioxanes decrease as the polarity of the solvent increases. The origin of the energy diﬀerences between epimeric pairs of 2,2-diphenyl −1,3-dioxanes bearing remote aryl substituents is likely electrostatic in nature. A Hammett plot , using either the calculated ΔH ° or ΔG ° values ( Table 2 ) versus σ p constants ( Figure 2 ) , is linear ( r = 0.98 ) with a slope of −0.6. An analysis of computed atomic charges and bond length changes as the aryl substituents are varied is in accord with an explanation for the experimental results that invokes intra- molecular electrostatic interactions as the dominant phenom- enon. Unfortunately , as noted above , the speciﬁc etiology of the observed eﬀects remain unclear .	0
ABSTRACT : The successful iron chloride - catalyzed Scholl reactions toward a series of polyphenylated carbazole derivatives diﬀering in their N - substitution are described. These reactions were found to be compatible over a series of polyaryls possessing ﬂuoro , methoxy , and methyl functional groups , subsequently leading to the synthesis of partially and completely annulated phenanthro- and tetracenocarbazoles in excellent yields. One major consequence of nonsubstitution on carbazolyl-N and the unsymmetrical framework of some of the derivatives is the low solubility of the product ; thus , a change from NH- to N-decyl on the carbazole nucleus was carried out. All newly developed derivatives were characterized by spectroscopic techniques , while the chemical structures of ﬂuorophenanthro- and methoxytetracenocarbazoles were conﬁrmed by single - crystal XRD analyses. The present eﬀorts may likely expand the family of growing heteroarenes for future applications as semiconductors and electroluminescent materials .	0
Our strategy toward the synthesis of 1 and 2 from 3 is given in Scheme 1. Asymmetric aminoxylation of 3 , followed by stabilized Wittig reaction and reduction of the N − O bond , gives the secondary allyl alcohol A. Dihydroxylation of A followed by reduction of the ester to a primary alcohol and its activation as a mesylate gives B. Simultaneous deprotection of the N-Boc group and acidolysis of the oxazolidine ring in B gives primary amine C as a salt. Treatment of C with a suitable base leads to intramolecular displacement of the mesylate to give cyclic derivatives , which on deprotection can give 1 and 2. The aldehyde 3 is a higher homologue of Garner ’s aldehyde ,	0
also labile under these conditions , hence chemoselective cleavage of either N-benzyl groups or N − O bond would be diﬃcult. To overcome this problem , nitrones 1b having acid- removable acetal - type substituents including glycosyl groups have been employed.2 Recently , N-Boc3 substituted and N- nosyl4 substituted nitrones 1c and 1d were reported to provide isoxazolidines having electron - withdrawing protective groups that facilitate reductive cleavage of N − O bond and that can be readily removed. In this context , N-nonsubstituted isoxazoli- dines 5 would also be attractive since they can be protected with usual N-protective groups such as carbamate and sulfonyl groups. One of the simplest ways to synthesize N-non- substiuted isoxazolidines would be intramolecular oxime − oleﬁn cycloadditions ( IOOC ) of oximes having oleﬁn moieties 3 via N-nonsubstituted nitrones 4.5 However , most of these reactions require high temperature and long reaction periods. In contrast to IOOC , we reported that O-silylated oximes 6 having oleﬁn ·OEt2 , underwent intramolecular moieties , on treatment BF3 cycloaddition via N-boranonitrones 7 under very mild conditions.6 More recently , it was also reported that intermolecular cycloaddition of C-ester substituted O-silylated oxime 8a aﬀorded 3,5-trans-cycloadducts as the major isomers.7 In this paper , we would like to report that cycloaddition of C- · amide substituted O-silylated oxime 8b in the presence of BF3 OEt2 produces 3,5-cis-cycloadducts predominantly probably via ·14 ( Scheme 3 ). The direct application of the complex BF3 present cycloaddition to the synthesis of syn-HPA-12 is also reported .	0
The new cyclization precursor was prepared in a fashion similar to compound 7. Treatment of 1 with an excess of 2- bromo-2-propen-1-yltrimethylsilane (10)23 aﬀorded allylation product 11 , again with the loss of the Boc-protecting group ( Scheme 4 ). 24 In addition to 11 , bicyclic compound 12 was also isolated as a mixture of diastereomers. Related bicyclic compounds have been reported from gold - catalyzed cycliza- tions between an N-Boc group and an alkyne25 or an allene.26 Compound 11 was isolated as a 9 : 1 mixture of isomers after chromatography. The relative cis stereochemistry between the allyl and the OTBS groups of the major isomer of 11 was elucidated by double pulsed ﬁeld gradient spin echo nuclear Overhauser eﬀect ( DPFGSE - NOE ) NMR experiments. It should be noted that the mixture of isomers could not be separated at any point in the synthesis prior to the ﬁnal product .	0

When the same conditions were employed for the CuAAC of linear peptoid 5b , which only diﬀers from 5a by a single CH2 group , our hypothesis was conﬁrmed ( Table 7 , entry 2 ). Careful analysis revealed that the monomeric cyclopeptoid 6b was selectively formed instead of the dimeric derivative. The same selectivity was obtained for linear peptoids 5c−5e and the cyclic products 6c−6e could be isolated in good to excellent yields ( entries 3 − 5 ). The structure of compound 6e was conﬁrmed by X-ray crystallography.54 Not surprisingly , the structurally diﬀerent peptoids 5f and 5g smoothly cyclized leading to the desired 6- and 7-membered ring structures ( entries 6 − 7 ). A high ring strain may also be the reason for compound 5h to not form a monomeric cyclopeptoid .	0

ABSTRACT : Mycobactins are small - molecule iron chelators ( siderophores ) produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) for iron mobilization. The bifunctional salicylate synthase MbtI catalyzes the ﬁrst step of mycobactin biosynthesis through the conversion of the primary metabolite chorismate into salicylic acid via isochorismate. We report synthesis , and biochemical evaluation of an inhibitor based on the putative transition state ( TS ) for the isochorismatase partial reaction of MbtI. The inhibitor mimics the hypothesized charge buildup at C-4 of chorismate in the TS as well as C − O bond formation at C-6. Another important design element of the inhibitor is replacement of the labile pyruvate side chain in chorismate with a stable C- linked propionate isostere. We developed a stereocontrolled synthesis of the highly functionalized cyclohexene inhibitor that features an asymmetric aldol reaction using a titanium enolate , diastereoselective Grignard addition to a tert-butanesulﬁnyl aldimine , and ring closing oleﬁn metathesis as key steps .	0
interconversion between these two species would need to be assumed in order these mechanisms are producing E-4a-Ph. In the adamantyl system , the rate - determining steps of each path have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent barriers. TS 3 of path B′ has a barrier of 25.6 kcal / mol , 8.6 kcal / mol greater than the barrier for PhCCl addition to 6b to aﬀord E-4b-Ph , which would indicate exclusive formation of product via path F′ these mechanisms were directly competing. We are thus left with two mechanistic possibilities : path B / B′ via stepwise addition of PhCCl to bridgehead alkene 3a or 3b to yield singlet diradical 10a-Ph or 10b-Ph and / or path F / F′ via PhCCl addition to diazo compound 6a or 6b. The question remains whether photolysis of 1a or 1b at λ = 350 nm at room temperature aﬀords the respective diazo isomer 6a or 6b. While the Platz group found the photolysis of noradamantyldiazarine 1a at λ = 350 nm to produce 3a via an excited state of 1a , as well as diazo isomer 6a , 350 nm irradiation of adamantyldia- zirine ( 1b ) formed only adamantyldiazomethane 6b.18,19	0

Thus , we next investigated the eﬀect of the ﬂuoro meso- azetidine 15 on growth inhibition eﬀects against various human cancer cells ( Table 1 ). The IC50 values of meso-azetidine 15 , ﬂuorouracil 18 , and gemcitabine 19 toward PANC-1 were 165.3 ± 9.1 , 33.7 ± 11.6 , and 122.9 ± 66.4 μM , respectively. It is noteworthy that growth inhibition potency of 15 against PANC-1 was equivalent to gemcitabine 19. Furthermore , 15 also showed superior inhibition spectrum widely against human liver carcinoma ( Hep G2 ) , human colon adenocarcinoma ( SW480 ) , and human breast adenocarcinoma cell line ( MCF-7 ) , with IC50 values of 80.3 ± 6.2 , 194.7 ± 1.2 , and 332.4 ± 50.2 μM , respectively. The inhibition mechanism of 15 is now under investigation , but the inhibition is similar to that of 18 and 19 as it had the same induction proﬁle of apoptosis for the cancer cells and the eﬀects depended on the incubation time .	0

The route begins with 6,6-dimethylfulvene , which was allowed to react neatly with dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate ( DMAD ) to yield the trienediester 3. Wilkinson ’s catalyst was employed to reduce the least substituted double bond , yielding 4. This reduction was followed by saponiﬁcation of the carbomethoxy groups with LiOH to form a dicarboxylic acid , which was then converted without workup into the corresponding anhydride using triﬂuoroacetic anhydride ( TFAA ).

However , judging from 2D NMR spectra ( COSY , NOESY , HMQC , and HMBC ) of the products , the carbonyl group at C- 9 clearly acted as a directing group , so the proton at C-1 of xanthone 1 was abstracted by the aryl lithium reagent acting as a base.

copper salts could eﬃciently promote the PNO - directed Csp2− H bond aryloxylation and alkoxylation.12 The above-mentioned works implied that PNO could be possibly used as an attractive platform for remote Csp3−H functionalization. Encouraged by these works , we expect that a suitable pyridine N-oxide- containing alkyl amide ( A ) not only may be employed as a bidetante functional group to form a palladabicyclic inter- mediate ( B ) but also may easily enable the Pd(II) → Pd(IV) process to occur due to the fact that PNO ( X-type ligand ) can increase the electron density at the Pd(II) center , and ﬁnally lead to the remote Csp3−H functionalization ( Scheme 1b ). ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION	0

ABSTRACT : A mild and eﬃcient Pd - catalyzed arylative domino carbocyclization of cyclohexadienone - containing 1,6-enynes is described. The reaction tolerates a variety of functionalized boronic acids to aﬀord a cis-fused bicyclic framework containing an α,β- unsaturated ketone with excellent regio- and diastereoselectivity in good yields. The tandem process proceeds with β-arylation of propargylic ether followed by conjugate addition of a vinyl palladium intermediate and subsequent protonolysis of a palladium enolate .	0

in heterocycle construction,18 here we report a new protocol to generate the chromeno[4,3-b]chromene skeleton by using the reaction of vinyl iodides and salicyl N-tosylhydrazones , which involves tandem carbene migratory insertion and intramolecular cyclization.

both weak ( CH3COOH ) and strong ( CF3SO3H ) organic acids were used in lieu of CF3COOH ; however , poorer yields were obtained in both these cases ( Table 1 , entries 2 and 3 ). Even a 3-fold excess of CF3COOH had no substantial eﬀect on the product yield ( Table 1 , entry 4 ). These observations suggest that neither the strength of acid nor their concentrations are the determining factors for better conversion. Thus , we attempted the reaction in the presence of Lewis acids instead of protic acids .	0
ing product 4i in comparably good yield and enantioselectivity. When a substrate with an alkyl substituent was employed , the desired product 4j was obtained in 64 % yield with moderate stereoselectivity. Notably , substrates with ortho-substituent patterns can provide the desired products 4f−4g in excellent yields and stereoselectivities in the absence of a Lewis acid , and the absolute conﬁguration of the product 4f was determined on the basis of X-ray crystal structural analyses.10 Subsequently , substrates with diﬀerent substituents ( R3 ) on the aromatic ring of phthalides were surveyed. It turned out that the chemical outcome and stereoselectivity rather relied upon the substituent patterns and electronic nature on the aromatic ring of phthalides. Phthalide bearing an electron - donating group at the 4-position provided the desired product 4k in good yield with an excellent es value and remarkable diastereoselectivity , whereas substrates possessing electron - withdrawing groups at the 4-position furnished functionalized dihydronaphthoqui- nones in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities , but moderate diastereoselectivities were obtained ( 4l−4n ).

photoisomerization in the AVB ﬂuoroionophores by conﬁning the trans double bond in a heterocycle decreases the rate of nonradiative decay , hence increasing the ﬂuorescence quantum yield. 3. Fluorescence Titrations of 1 − 4 with Zn(ClO4)2 in CH3CN. The ﬂuorescence quantum yields , lifetime , and emission maxima of compounds 1 − 4 under zinc(II) - free and zinc(II) - saturated conditions in CH3CN are listed in Table 3. Similar to their conﬁgurationally unlocked oleﬁn counterparts , the binding of zinc(II) ( in the form of Zn(ClO4)2 ) of the locked CT ﬂuoroionophores 2 and 4 in CH3CN leads to bathochromic shifts of their absorption and emission spectra ( Figures S6 and S7 , Supporting Informa- tion ). As an example , the zinc(II) titration data using compound 4 in both absorption and emission modes are included as Figure S9 , Supporting Information. Both lowest energy absorption and emission bands of 4 were red - shifted as zinc(II) titration proceeded. Therefore , this compound could be used for analyzing zinc(II) in a ratiometric mode , i.e. , the ratio of the absorption or the emission bands of the zinc(II)- free and the zinc(II) - bound forms , respectively , is a function of zinc(II) concentration. The p-methoxyphenyl-containing compounds 1 and 2 are capable of larger zinc(II) - induced emission bathochromic shifts ( Δν̃ em , Table 3 ) than the thienyl-containing 3 and 4 , suggesting that the p-methox- yphenyl group is a more eﬀective electron - donating group than the thienyl in CT type ﬂuorophores. Fluorescence quantum yield ( ϕ ) relates to the rates of both radiative ( kr ) and nonradiative ( knr ) decays ( eq 3 ). Unlike compounds 1	0
sized that the use of a readily available electrophilic SCF3 reagent , which might act as both an oxidant and SCF3 source , would allow the selective triﬂuoromethylthiolation event via a high Pd oxidation state. Our investigation started with the study of the Pd - catalyzed triﬂuoromethylthiolation of 1a with the N- SCF3-phthalimide I ( Table 1 ). To our delight , in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst , in DMF , the expected product 6a was detected albeit in very low yield ( entry 1 ). Several catalysts were then evaluated ( entries 2 − 4 ) , and gratifyingly Pd- [CH3CN]2Cl2 aﬀorded the expected triﬂuoromethylthiolated compound 6a in 26 % yield ( entry 4 ). 15 Notably , the structure of 6a was unambiguously conﬁrmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis.16 These promising results ascertained the regioselec- tive C − H triﬂuoromethylthiolation of a primary C(sp3)−H bond over the C(sp2)−H bond of the directing group. After intensive investigations , the addition of a Brønsted acid as additive ( entries 5 − 9 ) turned out to be highly beneﬁcial for the success of such C − S coupling reactions , pivalic acid being the most eﬃcient ( entry 9 , 31 % ). Remarkably , the triﬂuorome- thylthiolation proceeded smoothly at 70 ° C via a mild C − H activation process. Finally , the stoichiometry of the diﬀerent reactants was further ﬁne - tuned , oﬀering the optimal conditions for the synthesis of 6a in 53 % yield ( entry 11 ). Then , a screening of the electrophilic SCF3 sources was performed ( entries 11 − 16 ). No improvement was observed by using II , III , IV , or VI since poorer yields were obtained ( up to 27 % ) , while V gave 6a in 44 % yield. Notably , a control experiment performed in the absence of a Pd - catalyst revealed that no triﬂuoromethylthiolation reaction occurred ( entry 17 ). Finally , the nature of the directing group was then investigated .	0
The chemistry of halogenated ynamides has only been explored to a limited extent. While 2-iodoynamides have been used in for example cycloaddition27 and benzannulation28 reactions , the synthesis and reactivity of ﬂuorinated ynamides is a totally unexplored ﬁeld in organic chemistry. Only one report has been published in which the formation of a ﬂuorinated ynamine was described , albeit in a very low yield of 5 % .29 Over the last years , the chemistry of ynamides has received much attention.30 Due to the polarization of the triple bond , α- addition of nucleophiles across the triple bond is more common than β-addition , although a few examples of β- addition have been described.31 Umpolung of the ynamide	0

Less amount of 1 was obtained when a smaller ( entry 4 ) or greater ( entry 7 ) ratio of OH− to C70 was used , due to either the incompletion of the reaction or the overrun side reaction that leads to the formation of more toluene - insoluble polymeric materials.

benzotriazole and analogues from cheap and readily accessible phthaloyl peroxides. is particularly noteworthy that , compared to poor yields and a limited substrate scope of photochemically induced [ 2 + 2 ] and [ 2 + 4 ] cycloadditions,9 the Huisgen cycloaddition of organic azides with benzynes , photolytically generated from substituted phthaloyl peroxides , tolerates a wide range of functional groups and furnishes various benzotriazole derivatives in good yields under very mild conditions ( ambient temperature and neutral medium ). With the utilization of phthaloyl peroxides instead of widely used ortho-silyl phenyl the formation of potentially genotoxic triﬂuoromethanesulfonate side product is eliminated. Further applications of phthaloyl peroxide derivatives as benzyne precursors are currently ongoing in our laboratory .	0
Imino carbenoid derived from 1-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazole could also be trapped by heteroatoms such as sulfur,9 oxygen,10 and nitrogen,11 and subsequent [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement or cycloaddition resulted in the formation of heterocycles or compounds bearing heteroatom - substituted quaternary carbon if we used β-methylthio-α,β- atoms. We envisioned that unsaturated ketone 2 to react with in situ generated α-imino carbenoid B ( Scheme 1 ) , sulfur ylide C may be formed , and subsequent Michael addition of nitrogen would furnish zwitterionic intermediate D , which would lead to the formation of 3 by cleavage of carbon sulfur bond and reformation of carbon carbon double bond.

It is reported that the Voc of an OPV device is determined by the diﬀerence between the n - type conductor and the HOMO level of the p - type semiconductor.17 We previously reported that introduction of π-conjugated thiophene group on the fulleropyrrolidine eﬀectively modiﬁed the LUMO level of the compound and contributed to the enhancement of PCE of the corresponding OPVs.13 Therefore , we expected that higher PCE might be obtained for thiophene - substituted cyclo- pentene - fused [C60] - fullerenes. Unfortunately , PCE values of thiophene - substituted compounds were inferior to those of [C60] - PCBM and 1a ( entries 9 − 13 ). Among methyl , t-butyl , and MEM esters of thiophene derivatives ( 1i , 1j , and 1k ) , the best PCE was attained for MEM ester 1k ( entry 11 ). On the other hand , a better result in PCE was obtained for the simple methyl ester 1l ( entry 12 ) upon comparing the results obtained by bithiophene - substituted derivatives 1l and 1m ( entries 12 and 13 ) ; this was assumed to be from the poor FF value of 1m , while Jsc was superior to that of 1l .	0
Antimicrobial Activities of Chlorocatechelins A ( 1 ) and B ( 2 ). With a suﬃcient supply of pure 1 secured , we next investigated the biological eﬀects of 1 and its degraded derivative 2 on microbes. Antimicrobial assays of synthesized 1 , natural 2 , and vancomycin ( VCM ) were conducted against DFB - sensitive microbes ( Table 1 ) and DFB - insensitive ones ( Table 2 ). VCM was much more eﬀective against DFB- insensitive microbes though DFB - sensitive microbes were tolerant to VCM. Both 1 and 2 inhibited the growth of DFB- sensitive microbial including the ﬁsh pathogen Pasteurella piscicida at concentrations lower than those of DFB - insensitive ones. In addition , the high - aﬃnity siderophore 1 showed activities against DFB - sensitive strains more potent than those of the low - aﬃnity siderophore 2 and DFB. The Fe(III) - binding aﬃnity of 1 is higher than those of 2 and DFB in cyclic voltammetry experiments,5 indicating that 1 and 2 exhibited antimicrobial activities by limiting iron availability like that of DFB.12 ■ CONCLUSION	0

The controlled gold- catalyzed annulations allowed the formation of fused β-lactams without harming the sensitive four - membered heterocycle. Besides , a novel gold - catalyzed domino process , namely , the allenic hydroarylation / N1−C4 β-lactam bond breakage to aﬀord dihydro-oxepino[4,5-b]indole-4-carboxamides , has been discovered .	0

The precursor was prepared from 2-bromo-3-(trimethylsilylethynyl)naphthalene 117 ( Scheme 1 ). Treatment of 1 with diisobutylaluminum hydride ( DIBAL-H ) in THF followed by addition of N- bromosuccinimide ( NBS ) gave 2-bromo-3-[2-bromo-2- (trimethylsilyl)vinyl]naphthalene 2 as an inseparable mixture with 2-bromo-3-[2-(trimethylsilyl)vinyl]naphthalene. Lithiation of crude 2 with ca. 2 equiv of nBuLi , followed by sequential treatments with dichloro(phenyl)phosphine and hydrogen peroxide , aﬀorded 2-(trimethylsilyl)naphtho[2,3-b]phosphole P-oxide 3.

3.3. ESP on Molecular Surface. Electrostatic potential (ESP)40 on the molecular surface gives more meaningful insight into charge distributions and is useful for understanding intermolecular interaction.41 The ESP - mapped vdW surfaces of four title molecules are shown in Figure 4. Signiﬁcant surface local minima and maxima of ESP are represented as cyan and orange spheres and labeled by dark blue and brown - red texts with the unit in kcal / mol. Only the global minima and maxima on the surface are labeled by italic font. The surface areas in each ESP range are plotted in Figure 5 .	0

F-ribo 30 building block was prepared by PMB protection of 29. As the conﬁguration of ﬂuorine at C2′ is known , a strong vicinal trans coupling between two of the ﬂuorines ( 3J(F2′,F3′) = 15.0 ) in 31 indicates the 2′,3′-xylo diﬂuoro conﬁguration. 3J(1′,2′) is consistent with the 3′-endo The absence of conformation. The diﬂuorinated 2′,3′-dideoxy-2′,3′-FF-ribo 35 was pre- pared from the known lyxo-epoxide21 32 ( Scheme 4 ) following the Watanabe two - step process initiated by epoxide opening with a ﬂuoride ion exclusively from the α-face of the sugar to aﬀord a 3 : 1 ratio of regioisomers 3′-ﬂuoro-arabino 33 and 2′- ﬂuoro - xylo 34 in a 65 % combined yield. Treatment of this mixture with DAST furnished 35 in a 62 % yield.22 The regioisomeric ratio was determined by integration of the relevant peaks in the 19F NMR spectrum of the crude products. There was no need for the separation of 33 and 34 because both provide the same diﬂuoro product 35 after treatment with DAST. The presence of rather weak cis vicinal coupling between two ﬂuorines ( 3J(F2′,F3′) = 3.8 ) and a strong coupling between 1′-H and 2′-H ( 3J(1′,2′) = 5.0 ) indicates the 2′,3′-ribo diﬂuoro conﬁguration and C2′ - endo conformation .	0
improvement and sometimes decreased the yield. With shorter reaction times , the starting material was not entirely consumed. The preparation of hexabenzodecacyclene 4 was more the challenging. The starting ketone for acenaphthacenone 6 , was easily prepared by conventional AlCl3 - catalyzed Friedel − Crafts acylation / alkylation of naph- thacene with chloroacetyl chloride. Our treatment of 6 with TiCl4 in reﬂuxing ODCB obviously gave some trimer 4 , which appeared as a deep blue band on TLC , but the apparent instability of compound 4 to air and light made isolation diﬃcult. It seemed that compound 4 was formed in perhaps a 3 − 4 % yield in the reaction , as judged by the mass of crude 4 obtained by rapid fractionation of the reaction mixture , but only careful preparative TLC in the dark gave pure 4 , and then only in yields of < 1 % . Compound 4 is a stable blue - black solid , but its solutions are unstable under ordinary conditions. In bright ﬂuorescent room light , a dilute solution of 4 in CHCl3 undergoes decomposition with a half - life of 15 min , as judged by the reduction of its UV bands at 564 and 610 nm , and the appearance of new bands at 480 and 504 nm. TLC analysis ( solvent , CH2Cl2 ) showed no fewer than six new bands , all of them more polar than compound 4 , presumably because of the addition of oxygen to the molecule. Decomposition was much slower in the dark , but only in the absence of oxygen did solutions of compound 4 appear to be stable .	0

In addition to varying the 2-aminopyridine part , an overview of the inﬂuence of the substitution on the triple bond by using ﬁrst commercially available propargyl aldehydes was considered. Oct-2-ynal and 3-(trimethylsilyl)propioaldehyde were success- fully used in the MCR ( 5b and 5c ) ( Table 2 , entry 1 ). However , during the cyclization step , the optimized conditions previously found provided only starting material. Heating the reaction or increasing the reaction time favored only degradation without leading to the formation of the expected cyclized product. Our electrophilic cyclization using iodine is therefore restricted to aromatic ethynyl derivatives. In view of the lack of other easily available unsaturated aldehydes , we decided to examine the potent ability of N-tert-butyl-6-chloro-2-[2-(trimethylsilyl)- ethylnyl]imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-amine 5c to act as a useful precursor. recently reported a Sonogashira reaction on pyridylethynyltrimethylsilyl deriva- tives.12 Their experimental conditions were attempted on our substrate , and we were pleased to isolate 5q and 5r in good yield ( Scheme 4 ). This cross-coupling reaction enabled the introduction of aryl-substituents bearing either electron with- drawing or electron donating groups. Then , the cyclization step proceeded smoothly to provide the desired products 6q and 6r , the only diﬀerence being that the synthesis of electron	0

Quenching of the triplet - state lifetime of the photo- sensitizer by triplet energy acceptor ( perylene ) was studied to reveal the origin of diﬀerent TTA upconversion quantum yields ( Figure 12 ). With perylene as the triplet acceptor ( quencher ) , the quenching constant ( KSV ) of 1.6 × 106 M−1 was observed for compound 5 ( triplet energy donor ) , which is much higher than that of C-1 ( KSV = 2.0 × 105 M−1 ). The diﬀerent quenching constant is due to the diﬀerent triplet state lifetimes	0

ABSTRACT : A three - step procedure has been developed for preparing ortho-alkoxybenzaldehydes from ortho-ﬂuorobenzal- dehydes that tolerates the use of sterically hindered sodium alkoxide nucleophiles. The protocol is modular and opera- tionally convenient. The ortho-alkoxybenzaldehyde products can be converted in one additional step to ortho-alkoxystyrenes by a Wittig reaction. These styrenes are precursors to the chelating benzylidene moiety in a proposed series of novel ruthenium complexes for use in oleﬁn metathesis. Chelation with three representative styrenes has been demonstrated .	0
conditions for eﬃcient Rh - catalyzed exhaustive reductive arene o-silylation , as Takai and we reported that monodentate phosphines eﬀect Rh - catalyzed C − H silylation.10e,20 As seen in Table 1 , electron donating and sterically less hindered monodentate phosphine P(4-MeOPh)3 serves as the most eﬀective ligand ( 99 % yield , entry 4 ) for arene o-C − H silylation of aromatic esters. Notably , the Rh - catalyzed C − H silylation [ 0.4 mol % of Rh / (4-MeOPh)3P , 120 ° C ] was completed within 30 min.8f Other monodentate alkyl phosphines ( entries 5 − 7 ) and phosphites ( entries 8 − 9 ) resulted in lower yields. With the exception of BINAP and Xantphos ( entries 14 − 15 ) , bis- phosphine ligands with larger ligand bite angles generally increased product yields ( entries 10 − 15 ). 22 Upon the reaction conditions being optimized , the scope of the exhaustive , reductive C − H silylation of aromatic esters was explored and is shown in Table 2. Both electron - rich and -deﬁcient aromatic esters underwent exhaustive reductive arene o-silylation to aﬀord benzoxasiloles ( 6a − j ) in good yields. Furan , unprotected indole , silyl blocking group ( TBS ) , and trisub- stituted alkene within 6k − n tolerated the reaction conditions well. We observed complete regioselectivity within naphthoates ( 6o − p ) , where the C − H silylation of 1-naphthoate only provided naphthoxasilole 6o via selective activation of kinetically	0

Because the NEt2 groups were found in the initial reaction intermediates of 11 and DAST , we tentatively assumed that DAST preferentially reacted with the primary hydroxyl group in 11 to furnish intermediate 16 ( Scheme 3 ). On one hand , attack of ﬂuoride at the C-7 leaving group would aﬀord product 12 , which would continue to react with another equivalent of DAST to give intermediate 17. The carbonyl in the Cbz group then attacked the C-6 leaving group in SN2 mode , resulting in an inversion of the C-6 conﬁguration from the S-conﬁguration in 11 to the R-conﬁguration in 14. On the other hand , the C-6 hydroxyl in 16 could attack the C-7 leaving group , aﬀording epoxide 18,54,55 which would form intermediate 12 by attack of ﬂuoride56 or oxazolidinone 19 via intramolecular 5-exo-tet opening of the epoxide and give product 14 by reaction with another equivalent of DAST.

Because the NEt2 groups were found in the initial reaction intermediates of 11 and DAST , we tentatively assumed that DAST preferentially reacted with the primary hydroxyl group in 11 to furnish intermediate 16 ( Scheme 3 ). On one hand , attack of ﬂuoride at the C-7 leaving group would aﬀord product 12 , which would continue to react with another equivalent of DAST to give intermediate 17.

heterocycles ( i.e. , a pyrrole and an imidazole ) , building the central pyridine through the union of the smaller systems. It was hoped that the construction of the pyridine in this manner would obviate many of the challenges present in the original synthesis , minimize functional group interconversions , and result in a simpler and more eﬃcient approach to our desired heterocycle 1. Out of the three potential “ ring - forming ” bond formations within this strategy , we focused on disconnecting the 1,2-C − N bond via a proposed 6π-cyclization13 of amidine 2. The synthesis of this key intermediate would come from coupling a C5 - activated cyanoimidazole 3 with the known bromopyrrole 4.14 Despite the lack of solid precedent for amidine electrocyclizations of this type , we felt that the ease of many electrocyclizations,15 coupled with the potential for multiple conditions to mediate this key cyclization , supported the exploration of this strategy. Herein we describe the realization of this approach and the development of a Ni- mediated cyclization , which enabled the eﬃcient construction of this highly functionalized pyrrolopyridine in just 8 steps and 29 % overall yield.16 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In order to evaluate the proposed 6π-electrocyclization , it was necessary to synthesize the pyrrole − imidazole 7 ( Scheme 1 ). We proposed to accomplish this via a Suzuki coupling , starting from the C4 - brominated pyrrole 4. Preparation of the known 4- bromopyrrole 4 was accomplished in two steps from trichloroacetylpyrrole,17 which was followed by N-ethylation to give the N-ethylpyrrole 5 ( Scheme 1 ). The borylation of electron - rich heteroaromatic compounds can be diﬃcult due to the general the resulting electron - rich boronates ; 18 indeed , the formation of pyrrole 6 proved challenging. Initial screening results indicated that a combina- tion of KOAc / Pd(OAc)2 / Cy3P in toluene was capable of giving high yields of the desired boronate 6 ( > 95 % conversion with ∼ 99 : 1 selectivity for Miyaura borylation over proto-dehaloge- nation ). However , these conditions proved to be extremely capricious in a laboratory setting , with signiﬁcant amounts of	0
experimental and computational studies on the origin of the annuloselectivity between [ 2 + 2 ] and tandem annulations in the reactions of diacyl dichlorides and imines in the presence of triethylamine , further unraveling the mechanism of the tandem annulations ( Scheme 2b ). We believe that it is critical not only to our mechanistic understanding of the tandem annulations and annuloselectivity but also to guiding the further control and application of the reactions between diacyl dichlorides and imines in organic synthesis .	0

ABSTRACT : Eight acceptor - substituted distyrylbenzene ( DSB ) derivatives were obtained by postfunctionalization of dialde- hyde precursor 1 using Knoevenagel condensation. Solubility in a water / THF 9 : 1 mixture was achieved through the addition of branched oligoethylene glycol side chains. The acceptor compounds discriminate primary and secondary amines in aqueous solution. The ﬂuorescence responses were analyzed by the multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) protocol , a statistical tool. In contrast to 1 , the adducts show reactivity toward secondary and aromatic amines. Nitrooleﬁn 2f is the most active dosimeter molecule. Reaction with amines is completed after less than 3 min , and the limit of detection ( LOD ) is improved by a factor of 10. Propylenediamine can be detected at 75 μM. This is a 10-fold improvement for the detection limit when compared to the detection limit of the starting dialdehyde .	0

It was noticeable that substrates like 4-nitrobenzene-1,2- diamine , with a strongly electron - withdrawing -NO2 group at the para position , showed a pronounced eﬀect on oxidation of p-NH2 group , as 2,4-dinitroaniline ( 4j-a ) was formed as a major product over 2,5-dinitroaniline ( 4j-b ) ( Table 3 , entry 4j ). In the case of substrates like 4-chlorobenzene-1,2-diamine , with a less electron - withdrawing -Cl group , both products were obtained in almost equal amounts ( Table 3 , entry 4l ). The oxidation of substrates bearing acyl and aryl groups on benzene-1,2-diamine further conﬁrmed the role of hydrogen on a neighboring heteroatom in the oxidation of o-amine to nitro ( Table 3 , entries 4m and 4n ). Both substrates were smoothly oxidized to corresponding nitro derivatives in 20 min to give 87 % and 90 % yields , respectively. Furthermore , when we examined conventionally used oxidizing agents for selectivity ( Table 4 , entries 1 − 6 ) , it was observed that , except the oxidants showed formation of o-nitroaniline. In case of m-CPBA , only 28 % 4a formation was observed ( Table 4 , entry 6 ). In order to check this selectivity trend in other diperoxy acids , we carried out reaction of benzene-1,2-diamine with hexanebis(peroxoic acid ) and dodecanebis(peroxoic acid ) ( with 6 and 12 carbon atoms , respectively ) , which also give 100 % conversion to 2- nitroaniline with 90 % and 92 % isolated yields , respectively ( Table 4 , entries 7 and 8 ). Reaction of other diperoxy acids with substrates such as o-nitroaniline and o-toluidine also failed to show any oxidation of amino group under identical conditions. This conﬁrms the regio- and chemoselective nature of diperoxy acids for oxidation of aromatic amines. The reaction	0

However , the fact that the dienophile - containing moiety might possibly be a water - soluble biomolecule raised some doubts as to the feasibility of this synthetic alternative. To our knowledge , on - resin DA reactions44 have always been carried out in organic solvents , even on hydrophilic resins.45 The use of water is indeed advantageous , because the reaction takes place more quickly and in milder conditions than in organic solvents,18−20 but the outcome of cycloadditions between water - soluble maleimide - containing compounds and hydro- phobic diene-[protected polyamide ] - resins performed in water ( or solvents with a high water content ) was not obvious. Here we describe that such on - resin DA reactions in water ( Scheme 2a ) do provide the target conjugates , allowing diene− polyamides to be used in DA reactions. We also report that the scope of conjugation alternatives can be broadened by using protected maleimide derivatives and simultaneously carrying out maleimide deprotection and conjugation ( Scheme 2b ). This approach has been used to obtain conjugates with diﬀerent linking sites and in reactions involving maleimides derivatized with tagging agents such as ﬂuorophores and biotin , which are sparingly soluble in water. In case conjugates assembled by on- resin DA cycloaddition incorporate appropriate functional groups , an additional chemoselective conjugation reaction can be carried out to yield doubly derivatized molecules .	0

anes were synthesized from the corresponding 2-methyleneox- etanes 10a − n in moderate to high yields by a modiﬁed Simmon − Smith cyclopropanation.3 The methyleneoxetanes were obtained in good yields by methylenation of β-lactones 9a − n.11 Monosubstituted oxaspirohexanes rearranged to the corre- sponding 3-methylenetetrahydrofurans 6c − e in good yields ( Table 5 ). Similarly , trans-3-methylenetetrahydrofurans 6h − j were obtained in up to 80 % yield. Also of note , the reaction tolerated most aromatic groups , but for substrates with aryl groups directly attached to the oxetane ring , such as 4a , poor conversions and low yields were observed.

With the retrosynthetic plan in place , we began the forward synthesis with the oxidation of diacetone glucose 2 to ketone 14 using a modiﬁed version of a literature procedure as shown in Scheme 5.17 We were expecting the aldol reaction of 14 to produce regio- and stereochemical mixtures , and only after numerous screening experiments did we ﬁnd that ketone 14 undergoes an unusually selective reaction with aqueous formaldehyde in the presence of triethylamine using 2- methyltetrahydrofuran as a solvent.

An enzymatic approach to prepare 36S - labeled Met and 36S from milligram AdoMet quantities of labeled sulfur. Naphthalene promoted reduction of gram quantities of elemental sulfur has previously been used in the preparation of hexamethyldisilathiane , however , the Na2S was generated in situ and never isolated.17 This approach was scaled to allow for the reduction of 3 − 10 mg samples of elemental sulfur using 10 mol % naphthalene. Agitation in an ultrasonic water bath was used to promote sulfur reduction. The reaction mixture gradually turned from yellow to brown to dark green to white over the course of the reaction. After removing any remaining sodium metal and evaporating oﬀ the 36S was obtained as an oﬀ - white solvent , the resulting crude Na2 solid , which was used directly as a substrate for OAH2 without puriﬁcation. OAH2 catalyzes the displacement of acetate from 3 by inorganic S2− to give 4 and acetate as products.18 Crude Na2 36S was used directly as a substrate for OAH2 , along with varying quantities of freshly prepared O-acetyl-L-homoserine 3. After 16 h , the reaction products were analyzed using NMR spectros- copy ( Table 1 ). With equal concentrations of Na2S and 3 we observed the formation of 4 along with a signiﬁcant amount of the side product 5. Compound 5 is produced by OAH2 , where the product 4 reacts with 3 in the place of sulﬁde. In the presence of excess 3 we observed the side products almost exclusively. In the absence of OAH2 we observed no reaction between 3 and 4. Using a 2-fold excess of Na2S to 3 prevented the formation of 5.

Secondary amines , whether cyclic or acyclic , produced the corresponding 2-amino-benzimidazoles 1b , 1d , and 1e in good yields. A signiﬁcant but reduced yield of 39 % of compound 1c was obtained when performing the reaction with the relatively crowded N-methylcyclohexylamine. Primary amines can also be engaged in the reaction but proved to be less eﬃcient probably due to the competitive N - dealkylation under oxidative conditions.25 Biologically relevant NH2 N1-aryl-2-aminobenzi- midazoles26 could not be directly obtained using aqueous ammonia in the three - component process.27 However , as illustrated in Scheme 3 , deprotection of N2-tert-butyl amino- benzimidazole 1h was easily achieved by reﬂuxing in triﬂuoro- acetic acid in the presence of anisole , which acts as a butyl cation scavenger .	0
ABSTRACT : A series of 11 cross-conjugated cruciform ﬂuorophores based on a benzobisimidazole nucleus has been synthesized and characterized. Like in their previously reported benzobisoxazole counterparts , these new ﬂuorophores are localized along the vertical bisethynylbenzene axes , while their LUMOs remain relatively delocalized across the molecule , except in cruciforms substituted with electron- withdrawing groups along the vertical axis. Benzobisimidazole cruciforms exhibit a pronounced response to deprotonation in their UV / vis absorption and emission spectra , but their response to protonation is signiﬁcantly attenuated .	0
1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively ). The emission spectrum of 1 is well resolved in hexane solution , but is broad and featureless in THF and MeCN solutions with a solvatochromic shift of up to 1920 cm−1 , indicating that the emission is from a π − π* state in a nonpolar environment and from a state of greater charge- transfer character in more polar solvents. In contrast , the emission of 2 is more weakly solvatochromic , shifting only 330 cm−1 from hexane to MeCN solutions. It exhibits sharp , well- resolved emission in all three solvents with an average vibrational spacing between the most prominent bands of ca. 1350 cm−1 ( assigned to an average of aromatic ring vibrational modes ) , and thus a pure π − π* description is appropriate for the emission in all solvents studied. This is also revealed by its long pure - radiative lifetime , τ 0 , in hexane solution of 140 ns. The emission of 3 is similar to that of 1 , albeit slightly red- shifted ( 530 cm−1 in hexane solution ) and with an increased maximum solvatochromic shift of 2100 cm−1. The pure radiative lifetimes of these two compounds are also similar ( τ 0 = 40 ns ( 1 ) and 65 ns ( 3 ) in hexane solutions ) with little solvent dependence. Furthermore , 1 and 3 have shorter τ 0 values than 2 in hexane solution ; the τ 0 value of 2 also has a moderate solvent dependence , shortening to 78 ns in MeCN solution. Compound 2 has excellent quantum yields in all solvents , having a value as high as 0.89 in MeCN solution ; this is attributable to its low and almost solvent independent nonradiative decay rate , knr , while having a larger , only weakly solvent dependent radiative rate , kr. Even though increased nonradiative decay leads to somewhat quenched emission for 1 and 3 in more polar solvents , moderately high quantum yields of 0.42 ( 1 ) and 0.22 ( 3 ) are still achieved in MeCN solutions. While the amino substituent clearly aﬀects the orbital structure of pyrene , such that charge transfer becomes feasible , the cyano group is poorly conjugated and serves only to make the pyrene slightly more electron accepting. These conclusions are broadly in accord with theoretical calculations , vide infra .	0
All four compounds are weakly emissive , with maximum emission ( λ em ) observed between 626 and 681 nm ( Figure 1b , Figures S25 and S26 in the Supporting Information , and Table 2 ). The trend observed for the wavelengths of maximum em values of 7b − d being absorption is mirrored here , with the λ red - shifted with respect to 7a. Quantum yields for all four complexes are below 0.05. However , the observed Stokes shifts ( ν ST 124 nm , 3590 cm−1 ; 7c , ν ST 125 nm , 3301 cm−1 ). Complexes 7a − d ( six π electrons ) are electrochemically active , exhibiting two reversible one - electron reduction waves corresponding to the reversible formation of ligand - centered radical anions ( seven π electrons ) and dianions ( eight π electrons ) , respectively ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ). Closely related Kuhn - type verdazyls 9 and 6-oxoverdazyls 10 ( seven π electrons ) , which also beneﬁt from signiﬁcant delocalization and stabilized frontier molecular orbitals due to the presence of four nitrogen atoms in their heterocyclic backbones , exhibit similar redox behavior and can be reversibly oxidized to cations ( six π electrons ) and anions ( eight π electrons ). 16c The reduction potentials observed for 7a − d become less negative ( easier to reduce ) as naphthyl substituents are introduced ( 7a , − 0.82 and − 1.89 V ; 7b , − 0.81 and − 1.88 V ; 7c , − 0.80 and − 1.85 V ; 7d , − 0.78 and − 1.78 V ).

ABSTRACT : Approaches toward the syntheses of alkaloids belonging to the 2,6-disubstituted 3-hydroxypiperidine and cis- decahydroquinoline ( cis-DHQ ) classes of alkaloids are developed , starting from a common chiral nonracemic bicyclic lactam lactone ( BLL ). Two key δ-lactam intermediates , (5S,6S)-5- hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl- and (5S,6S)-5-hydroxy-6-methyl- piperidin-2-ones , are prepared ; the latter δ-lactam is obtained via a direct decarbonylation of a bicyclic lactam lactol. The BLL is also used to prepare (4aR,5R,8aS)- and (4aR,5S,8aS)-5-methyl- octahydroquinolin-2-ones , which involved a 6-exo-trig free - radical conjugate addition reaction. The stereoselectivity observed in the free - radical cyclization step is found to be governed by allylic 1,2-strain arising from the interaction of the N-(p-methoxybenzyl) group and the C6 substituent in the lactam ring of the free - radical intermediate. The eﬀectiveness of the developed approaches is demonstrated by the asymmetric syntheses of (+)-2-epi-deoxoprosopinine , (−)-deoxoprosophylline , (+)-cis-195A , and 2,5-di-epi- cis-195A .	0
the chemical structure of hetero[4]rotaxane 1 is stereochemically more complicated than it has been drawn in Scheme 2 , which is due to the direction of threading of the benzylalkylammonium component and the asymmetric features of the B21C7 ring. Although there is free rotation about the link between B21C7 and the rest of the thread , this does not remove the isomerism , as the B21C7 macrocycle is inherently unsymmetrical. The direction of threading of the ester component can be either syn or anti when the triazole thread is drawn in a symmetrical conformation. Theoretically , two diastereoisomers : the anti product has a pair of enantiomers , while the syn product is meso. However , this isomerism has no discernible eﬀect on the 1H NMR spectrum and is hard to detect , and thus no selectivity is observed between diaster- eoisomers.

Herein we report the development of an eﬃcient synthesis of alkenylphosphonates with good yields and excellent stereo- selectivity through Pd - catalyzed coupling of α-diazo arylme- thylphosphonates with benzyl and ally halides. The method can also be extended to the coupling reaction of N-tosylhydrazones with aryl bromides .	0

Stereocontrolled Route Development. Despite having access to large quantities of all four isomeric metabolites 3 , the corresponding analytes 13 , and an NMR - based assignment of stereochemistry , rigorous stereochemical assignment of the identity of each isomer was still desirable. As such , our stereocontrolled route to all four active clopidogrel metabolites began by triaging the stereocenters. Previous studies in our laboratories had demonstrated the facile separation of the E- and Z - isomers , so the problem was reduced to selectively installing both epimers of the C-4 thiol functionality and the 7S-conﬁguration of the o-chlorophenylglycine moiety ( Scheme 10 ). Our retrosynthetic analysis divided the molecule into the commercially available amine S-17 and dialdehydes 25. It was envisioned that dialdehydes 25 could be prepared from the known cyclopentanones 27 where the stereochemistry of the cyclic acetonide could be used to control the stereochemistry at	0
( iii ). Reactive Intermediates in the 18O Exchange Process. The mechanism in Scheme 3 is tentative and is based on nitrosamines 1 and 2 and the dimerization of their corresponding nitrooxides in preference to the unimolecular cyclization of nitrooxides. Computations indicate high - energy barriers for the nitrooxide dimerization to hexaoxadiazocane C and for the conversion of nitrooxide A to trioxazetidine B. Thus , photochemical interconversions would be necessary to overcome the high barriers. We note there are similarities between our work and the previous literature. That is , nitrooxide A bears similarity to the nitrosooxide , an intermediate formed in the reaction of nitrenes with 3O2.40−49,61,62 Relatedly , the trioxazetidine B is reminiscent of the 1,2,3,4-dioxadiazete , which along with its radical cation	0

Next , by using optimized reaction conditions , several o- iododiaryl ethers ( 3a − p ) were prepared from the commer- cially available phenols bearing electron - withdrawing groups such as −NO2 , −CN , −CHO , −COCH3 , −CONR2 , −CONHR , −CO2R , etc. in moderate to excellent yield ( Scheme 2 ). Notably , 4-substituted phenols lead to the desired product in good yield whereas 3-substituted phenols lead to a mixture of iodo-derivatives in moderate yield. the reaction of phenol , bearing an electron- Nevertheless , donating or -neutral group ( e.g. , phenol , p-cresol , 4-hydroxy anisole ) , did not produce any 2-phenoxyaryl iodide. Thus , it may be revealed that the presence of electron - withdrawing groups in the aromatic ring that imparts a balance between the nucleophilicity of the phenol and the electron deﬁciency in the ring is responsible for the cascade iodination and O- arylation process. Eventually , diﬀerently aryl-substituted hypervalent iodine reagents were also found to be useful to produce o-iododiaryl ethers in good yield. Thus , when p-	0

In 1993 , the Isoe group found that the electroinitiated oxygenation of alkynes in the presence of thiophenol gave α-(phenylthio) carbonyl compounds.4c Also , Renaud et al. reported that the reaction of terminal alkynes with thiophenol in the presence of AIBN aﬀorded a series of ﬁve - membered cyclic compounds.4e − g In continuation of our eﬀorts on difunctionalization reactions,5 herein , we report a new protocol , TBHP ( tert-butyl hydro- peroxide ) - initiated water - catalyzed difunctionalization of termi- nal alkynes with thiophenol in air at room temperature to give α- thioaldehydes .	0
ABSTRACT : The stereoselective transformation of α-alkoxyacetoalde- hydes to the corresponding (Z)-vinyl triﬂates was achieved by treatment with phenyl triﬂimide and DBU. The stereochemistry was explained by the “ syn-eﬀect , ” which was attributed primarily to an σ → π* interaction. The β-alkoxy vinyl triﬂates obtained were applied to the stereoselective synthesis of structurally diverse (Z)-allylic alcohols via transition metal- catalyzed cross-coupling reaction and [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement .	0

129Xe NMR Spectroscopy. The use of hyperpolarized xenon multiplies the NMR signal by several orders of magnitude and facilitates the detection of a low concentration of Xe @ cryptophane complexes dissolved in water or organic solvents. Thus , not only can ligand - decorated cryptophanes be good candidates for xenon biosensing , but hyperpolarized 129Xe NMR ( combined with 1H NMR ) can also serve to understand the synthesis yields and the behaviors of some intermediate compounds. Derivatives 7 , 13 , and 14 are interesting compounds as xenon hosts , but in contrast to compounds 1 , 2 , and 8 , these molecules are only soluble in organic solvents. Thus , the interaction of xenon with these derivatives was investigated in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 , a solvent that does not enter the cavity of cryptophanes 7 , 13 , and 14.19	0
The minimum energy S1 , B3LYP / 6-31G(d) , optimized structures were further subjected to the TD 10 states energy calculations20 in order to get emissions , and the results are summarized in Table 6. From the calculated emissions , it can be seen that , there is negligible inﬂuence of changes in solvent polarity on the emission of novel PM dyes 2 − 4.

Similarly , the TD - DFT emissions for the dye 3 in various solvents are associated with the LUMO → HOMO transition and centered around 463.5 − 474.3 nm with oscillator strengths in the range of 0.59 − 0.60 ( Table 6 ) .	0
The chemistry of highly energetic materials is still a very active research topic , especially the issue of high energy dense oxidizers ( HEDOs ) , which have been investigated intensively in recent years.1 Oxidizers are compounds that release an excess of oxygen , which reacts with fuel and produce large amounts of hot gases sparsely investigated energetic functionality which emerged is the primary nitrocarbamates.1e,2 This energetic chemical moiety can be synthesized starting from polynitro alcohols. The previously described synthesis of carbamates starts with the reaction of the corresponding alcohol with phosgene to form the chloroformate , which is then further treated with ammonia ; the carbamate is nitrated subsequently to the nitrocarbama- te.2a,3 In the case of 2,2,2-trinitroethanol , this synthesis route proceeds quite satisfactorily but has still some disadvantages.1e The hazardous handling with the highly toxic gas phosgene needs to be addressed , and the use of alkaline reagents is problematic because of the instability of polynitro alcohols in basic media.3,4 It has been found that a much advanced versatile synthesis route of the carbamate moiety is a one - step synthesis with the reagent chlorosulfonyl isocyanate ( CSI ). CSI is a commercially available reagent and was discovered in Germany in 1956.5 It consists of a sulfuryl center with two electron- withdrawing components , the chloro atom and the isocyanate group , which results in one of the most reactive isocyanates.5a,6 The reaction with alcohols is very fast and proceeds via nucleophilic addition to the isocyanate carbon at low temperatures and without possible multiaddition prevented by the formation of a chlorosulfonylamide intermediate. This SO2Cl group is removed by aqueous workup to form chlorosulfonate and produces the pure carbamate. In summary , the advantages of CSI are monosubstitution , fast reaction times , simple workup , and often nearly quantitative yields .	0

1.1. Mechanistic Considerations. For the development of the three - component reaction , the in situ generation of a reactive acylimine species as electrophilic amidoalkylating agent was assumed to be the ﬁrst crucial step. Therefore , we investigated the two - component reaction between formaldehyde and benzamide , which should lead to the corresponding acylimine or acyiminium ion. However , we were not able to detect or isolate any acylimine species.26 The only product we could obtain from the two - component reaction was bisamide 11 , derived from a two-fold addition of benzamide to formaldehyde. This bisamide is formed very rapidly in almost quantitative yield ( Scheme 4 ) .	0

the medicinal chemistry.

To complete the isomerization study , one has to consider the interconversion between the two isomers involved in the previous mechanism ( branched and linear E ) with the third stereoisomer , the linear Z species. Since a direct interconversion between the E and Z isomers of the linear substrate would involve a prohibitive rotation around a CC double bond , the actual change occurs via the branched isomer. However , the shift of the ester group from one oleﬁn C atom to intermediate similar to G the other , through a cyclic acetal ( Figure 10 ) , must take place with the appropriate conformation of the carbon chain in order to yield the Z isomer of the linear substrate .	0

■ INTRODUCTION The Tsuji − Trost reaction is a powerful method to append both O- and C-donors to η3-allyl systems.1 The η3-allyl progenitor structures include allylic esters , carbonates , halides , and oxides. Internal allylic oxides2 remain one of the few systems that retain a marker of stereochemical induction with the newly liberated carbinol. The origin of the products can be traced to the diastereomeric η3-allyl intermediate and stereoisomer of oxide employed. We have recently identiﬁed3 a system capable of the conversion of racemic allylic oxides to distinct enantioenriched regioisomers using achiral phenol donors ( Scheme 1 ). The	0
of boronic acids.17 Under these conditions , vinylcyclopropane 1 reacted smoothly with phenylboronic acid to provide the linear trans ring - opened product in high yield and selectivity ( entry 1 ). Importantly , these conditions negated the use of additional ligands or organic solvents , rendering the process operationally simple ; the reaction could also be carried out in air. The importance of the catalyst was highlighted by the observation that under aqueous conditions in the absence of any catalyst a low conversion to a roughly equal amount of branched / linear product was observed ( entry 4 ). Low conversion was also observed when the reaction was carried out in wet THF ( entry 5 ) , and only trace product was observed in anhydrous THF ( entry 6 ). Using Pd(PPh3)4 as an alternative source of Pd(0) proved ineﬀective with no product being observed ( entry 7 ). Using the optimized conditions , a range of boronic acids were added to vinylcyclopropane 1 in generally high yield and linear selectivity ( Table 2 ). A range of aryl- and alkenylboronic acids proved eﬀective , giving generally excellent yields and linear trans selectivity. Electron - deﬁcient arylboronic acids generally gave the desired product in excellent yield ( entries 2 − 5 , 7 , 9 , and 10 ). Ortho substitution was also tolerated ( entry 5 ). The yield was lower for more electron - rich systems and naphthyl-derived boronic acids ( entry 6 , 8 , and 11 ). A cyano group could also be tolerated as the electron - withdrawing group on the vinylcyclopropane ( entry 13 ). Alkenylboronic acids could also be coupled in moderate yield and with complete linear selectivity. ( entry 12 ) .	0

The NMR spectra of hyperporphyrins induced by protonation are typically very complex because of the multiple possible protonation states. Nevertheless , an early study of protonated porphyrins with p-(dimethylamino)phenyl substituents was successful in identifying hyperporphyrin NMR spectra.11 The study showed that the addition of triﬂuoroacetic acid to the porphyrins caused the internal porphyrin N − H to be chemically shifted downﬁeld , while the β-hydrogens of the pyrroles were found to move upﬁeld during the formation of the hyper- porphyrin form. These changes were attributed to diminished ring current eﬀects , which could arise from geometric distortion of the porphyrin core. The porphyrins in this study include three diﬀerent potential sites for protonationthe porphyrin interior , the peripheral pyridyl groups , and the peripheral aminophenyl groupsand protonation states from neutral to + 6. Spectrophotometric characterizations were successful in distinguishing the order of protonation and gave distinct spectra for most of the intermediate stages of protonation.12 For these studies , we used a thin - layer cell to measure UV − vis spectra of the same solutions that were used for the NMR spectra , allowing us to identify the speciﬁc protonation state under study based on our earlier work.12 The structures of the aminophenyl / pyridyl porphyrins are shown in Figure 2 with our standard abbreviations for each porphyrin .	0

The diﬀerence of diastereomeric complexes is comparable with other , well - known chiral derivatizing and solvating agents ( e.g. , Mosher ’s acid , Pirkle ’s alcohol ). Diastereomeric salts of racemic acids (RS)-1 and (RS)-2 with biologically active amines (1R,2S)-ephedrine and (S)-dapoxetine were also investigated by 19F NMR spectroscopy .	0
6 ) has exhibited its great potential in catalytic asymmetric 1,3- DCs,7c,10b,d which is far superior to mono-CPAs in terms of enantioselective control. Therefore , we tentatively utilized Bis- PA ( 6 ) as a catalyst to the model reaction. Indeed , this reaction under the catalysis of Bis-PA ( 6 ) delivered the product 4aa in a much higher enantioselectivity of 68 % ee albeit with a moderate yield of 61 % ( entry 8 ). Then , in the presence of Bis-PA ( 6 ) as the most suitable catalyst , the model reaction was subjected to a variety of solvents mainly including arenes and chloro- substituted alkanes ( see the Supporting Inforamtion for details ) with the aim of further improving the enantioselectivity. It was found that chloroform could oﬀer the reaction in the highest enantioselectivity of 82 % ee , although the yield was decreased to some extent ( entry 10 ). Thus , chloroform was selected as an optimal reaction medium for subsequent condition optimiza- tion .	0
To shed light on the plausible bifunctional mechanism , DFT the SMD-M06-2X / 6-311+G** level were calculations at performed for both bifunctional reaction pathways ( Supporting Information ). The calculated activation barriers ( ΔG⧧ ) for the key protonation transfer step leading to the formation of product 11 are 90.0 and 8.3 kJ mol−1 , for ternary complexes 13 ( via pathway A ) and 14 ( via pathway B ) , respectively. When these values are compared with the activation barrier of the second protonation step in the monofunctional mechanism , it is obvious that the bifunctional Brønsted − Lewis acid activation mechanism is favored over the other two pathways. Hence , we envisage that at a higher concentration of alk-3-ynoate ( [10] ) , more ternary complex 14 is formed and the proton transfer step from ternary complex 14 , which has an activation barrier lower than that of the monofunctional pathway , yields product 11. It thus appears that the isomerization reaction follows the monofunctional mechanism at a concentration of alk-3-ynoate ( [10] ) lower than 0.1 M and favors the bifunctional Brønsted− Lewis acid activation mechanism ( via pathway B ) at higher alk- 3-ynoate concentrations. Our proposed monofunctional / bifunctional mechanisms are consistent with observed kinetic behaviors at diﬀerent substrate concentrations .	0
ABSTRACT : As part of ongoing eﬀorts in this laboratory to design and synthesize multidentate soft-N-donors as eﬀective complexants for chemoselective minor actinide extraction from used nuclear fuel , a series of aminated mono-1,2,4- triazinylpyridines were required. This study focuses on streamlining convergent access to a diverse array of function- alized N-donors using Pd - catalysis from a common synthon triazines as the 4,4′-amino aﬀording access to pyridinyl derivatives which are commercially limited and unsuccessful in traditional condensation chemistry. A general Pd - catalyzed method for the double amination of functionalized pyridinyl-1,2,4-triazines with low catalyst / ligand loadings enabling the formation of 16 novel complexants is presented .	0
ABSTRACT : We discovered that phenanthro[9,10-d]- imidazoles bearing a 2-halogenoaryl substituent at position 2 undergo swift photochemically driven direct arylation , leading to barely known phenanthro[9′,10′:4,5]imidazo[1,2-f ]- phenanthridines. The reaction is high - yielding , and it does not require any sensitizer or base. The discovered process is tolerant of a variety of substituents present both at positions 1 and 2 ; i.e. , strongly electron - donating and electron-with- drawing substituents are tolerated as well as various heterocyclic units. Steric hindrance does not aﬀect this process. The evidence gathered here indicates that SRN1 mechanism is operating in this case with the formation of radical anion as a critical step , followed by heterolytic cleavage of a carbon − halogen bond. Also TfO groups were shown to undergo cyclization , which allows the use of salicylaldehydes in the construction of heterocyclic systems. Eﬃciency of this photochemically driven direct arylation has been demonstrated by the synthesis of two systems possessing 13 and 17 conjugated rings , respectively. Phenanthro[9′,10′:4,5]imidazo[1,2-f ]phenanthridines are blue - emitters , and they exhibit strong ﬂuorescence in solution and in the solid state in direct contrast to their precursors .	0
■ INTRODUCTION Since the seminal report of Prileschajew in 1909,1 stereospeciﬁc epoxidation of an oleﬁn with a peracid has become a standard part of the organic chemist ’s synthetic arsenal. Arguably one of the most useful aspects of this reaction is its ability to be directed by an adjacent functional group within the substrate , resulting in a diastereoselective reaction.2 Perhaps the most well - known example of this phenomenon is the use of an allylic hydroxyl functionality to direct the stereochemical course of epoxidation through formation of a hydrogen bond in the transition state.3,4 Relatively fewer examples , however , have been reported with ureas,5 sulfonamides,6 carbamates,6−8 amides,6,7,9−12 or protonated amines13−15 as the directing groups , with the N − H proton in these systems proposed to act as the hydrogen - bond donor ( in the absence of an N − H proton , epoxidation under steric control results ). 6,16,17 Within this area , we are currently engaged in a research program concerning the development and deployment of eﬃcient methods to enable the diastereoselective epoxidation of a range of allylic amines.18 We have reported two complementary methods to eﬀect the formal anti-dihydroxylation of the oleﬁn functionality within 3-N,N-dibenzylaminocyclohex-1-ene 1 in a diastereodivergent manner.19,20 Sequential treatment of 1 with Cl3CCO2H ( 5 equiv ) and m-CPBA ( 1.6 equiv ) was shown to give trichloroacetate ester 4 in 95 : 5 diastereoisomeric ratio ( dr ) ; 4 may be isolated or the crude reaction mixture may be	0
the fact that the in situ generated imine could be further incorporated into the reaction in a cascade manner.8 In the presence of diﬀerent transition - metal catalysts , nitrone alkynes could undergo versatile transformations. Shin and co-workers reported that under the catalysis of cationic Au(I) , isoindole derivatives could be obtained eﬃciently ( eq 2a ). 5g Pati and Liu aﬀorded α-pyridone derivatives through a ruthenium - catalyzed cycloisomerization of nitrone alkynes ( eq 2b ). 5h Shin and co- workers reported an AuCl3 - catalyzed tandem reaction of nitrone alkyne and diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate , obtaining the tricyclic product with fair yield ( eq 3 ). 5i Li ’s group5e found that the azomethine ylide9 intermediates I , formed by the iridium- catalyzed cycloisomerization of nitrone alkynes , could be isolated or directly used for a one - pot [ 3 + 2 ] cycloaddition reaction ( eq 4 ). 10 Interestingly , in all of these examples , N- alkylnitrones were employed exclusively for the intramolecular cycloisomerization reaction. Herein , we describe a palladium- catalyzed cycloisomerization / dipolar cycloaddition cascade of N-arylnitrone alkynes with electron - deﬁcient oleﬁns ( eq 5 ) .	0
Development of a General Procedure for Synthesiz- ing N1 - Substituted 7-Deazaadenosines. Construction of the N1-carbcyclic ribosyl-7-deazaadenosine structure was a challenge in the present study , because there are no reported procedures providing this type of nucleoside structure. Synthesis of 7-deazaadenosine and its derivatives has been studied extensively due to their biological importance , and the Lewis acid - promoted glycosidation between a silylated 6- chloro-7-deazaadenine base and a tetra-O-acyl ribose , devel- oped by Seela and co-workers , is thought to be the best procedure in terms of synthetic usefulness , i.e. , excellent yield and product scope.13 This method , however , was not applicable to our synthesis of 7-deaza-cADPcR because substitution at the N1 - position of 7-deazaadenosine derivatives is diﬃcult. The only example of such an N1 - substitution of 7-deazaadenosine derivatives reported to date is the N1 - methylation of 7- deazaadenosine by treating 7-deazaadenosine with a large excess of MeI.14	0

method ( DFT , in particular B3LYP , see the Experimental Section for further details ). As expected , the lowest rotational barrier is calculated for compound 31 ( 13.2 kcal / mol by MM2 , Figure 4 , and 10.0 kcal / mol by DFT ) , where the most stable conformation is with the phenyl ring twisted around 52 ° with respect to the indacene core. The presence of a ﬂuorine atom at the ortho position in 38 hinders the phenyl motion as reﬂected in a higher rotational barrier ( 18.6 kcal / mol by MM2 , Figure 4 , and 15.7 kcal / mol by DFT ) and a higher twisting angle ( 60 ° ). However , owing to its small size , the steric hindrance seems not to be high because its ﬂuorescence eﬃciency is still low ( 8.7 % , Table 4 ). Further evidence is provided by compound 12 bearing an o-bromine. Its larger size should induce a higher steric hindrance to the phenyl motion , reﬂected in a higher rotational barrier ( 28.1 kcal / mol by MM2 and 25.1 kcal / mol by DFT ) and a more twisted 8-phenyl ( 65 ° ) , which leads to an improved ﬂuorescence signal ( 29.5 % Table 4 ). In line with this argument , compound 45 shows a larger rotational barrier ( around 35 kcal / mol by MM2 and 37.6 by DFT ) and a more perpendicular disposition ( phenyl the geometrical constraint provided by the hydroxymethylene seems to be high enough to lock the phenyl ring motion , thereby giving rise to very high ﬂuorescence eﬃciencies ( up to 87.8 % , Table 4 ). Similar energy values have been reported for the rotational barrier of structurally related 8-aryl-BODIPYs.37 It is noteworthy that the low - demand ( from a computationally point of view ) and fast MM2 method describes in a qualitative way the evolution of the rotational barrier with regard to the steric hindrance induced by the ortho substitution , although the energy values deviate around 3 kcal / mol ( usually MM2	0
■ CONCLUSIONS In summary , we have demonstrated the ligand - assisted palladium - catalyzed regioselective oxidative C(sp2)−H activa- tion for dehydrogenative homocoupling and C − H oxygen- ation reactions in the phenyl ring of substituted 1-phenyl- pyrazoles. The scope has been explicitly investigated to demonstrate the eﬀect of diﬀerent substitutions on the outcome of the set of compounds wherein the pyrazole ring does not bear any substitution under low quantities of TFA / TFAA ( 9 : 1 , v / v ) mixture ( higher substrate concentration ) aﬀorded the biaryl bis-pyrazoles via dehydrogenative homocoupling exclusively. However , resulted in the ( o- hydroxyphenyl)pyrazoles as the major products when the identical reaction was performed in the presence of an increased quantity of TFA / TFAA ( 9 : 1 , v / v ) mixture ( low substrate concentration ). Further , if the phenyl ring carried an ortho-substituent then monohy- droxylation took place but if both the ortho-positions were free then bis-hydroxylation prevailed under the conditions. Unlike in the set of compounds where the pyrazole ring carried the carboxylate group at the 3-position , in most of the cases a mixture of biaryl bis-pyrazoles and (o-hydroxyphenyl)- pyrazoles were formed under higher substrate concentration , but (o-hydroxyphenyl)pyrazoles were isolated in superior yields when the concentration of the starting material was low. In addition for these starting substrates , the protocol worked only when both ortho-positions of the phenyl ring were free since all compounds bearing an ortho-substituted phenyl the pyrazole substrates bearing a carboxylate group at the C-5 or C-4 position , mostly biaryl bis-pyrazoles were isolated. Interestingly , for the pyrazoles bearing a phenyl group at the C-3 position in place of the carboxylate group at lower substrate concentration we could isolate only the ( o- hydroxyphenyl)pyrazole with no trace of biaryl bis-pyrazoles. Further work to investigate the ligand - assisted C - oxygenation in the phenyl ring in other heterocyclic substrates is underway and will be reported in due course .	0

ABSTRACT : Invader probes have been proposed as alternatives to polyamides , triplex - forming oligonucleotides , and peptide nucleic acids for recognition of chromosomal DNA targets. These double- stranded probes are activated for DNA recognition by + 1 interstrand zippers of pyrene - functionalized nucleotides. This particular motif forces the intercalating pyrene moieties into the same region , resulting in perturbation and destabilization of the probe duplex. In contrast , the two probe strands display very high aﬃnity toward complementary DNA. The energy diﬀerence between the probe duplexes and recognition complexes provides the driving force for DNA recognition. In the present study , we explore the properties of Invader probes based on larger intercalators , i.e. , perylene and coronene , expecting that the larger π-surface area will result in additional destabilization of the probe duplex and further stabilization of probe − target duplexes , in eﬀect increasing the thermodynamic driving force for DNA recognition. Toward this end , we developed protocols for 2′-N-methyl-2′-amino-2′- deoxyuridine phosphoramidites that are functionalized at the N2′ - position with pyrene , perylene , or coronene moieties and incorporated these monomers into oligodeoxyribonucleotides ( ONs ). The resulting ONs and Invader probes are characterized by thermal denaturation experiments , analysis of thermodynamic parameters , absorption and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy , and DNA recognition experiments. Invader probes based on large intercalators eﬃciently recognize model targets .	0

Although PI has many possible pKa values for the amine moieties ( vide supra ) , only one pKa was required to ﬁt the data , and two species were relevant in this reaction : a partially protonated species ( e.g. , bipolar ) with some neutral amine groups with neighboring protonated groups ( molar fraction χ PI+ , kPI+ ) and a totally deprotonated species with neutral amine groups ( χ − ). In the presence of MNI , an additional species was considered , regarding the deprotonated imidazolide − ) , known to form at pH ∼ 12 for group ( χ nitroimidazoles.15 All these possible pathways are illustrated in Scheme 2 .	0
ABSTRACT : Three types of racemic [5]helicenyl acetates ( 1a , 2 , and 3a ) were synthesized. The synthesis of 2 was achieved by regioselective oxidation using o-iodoxybenzoic acid. The enzymatic kinetic resolution of 1a−3a was studied. The conversion with the highest rate and ee was obtained using 1a as the substrate and lipase Amano PS-IM as the enzyme. The two enantiomers of 1-[5]helicenol 3b were separated using (1S)-10-camphorsulfonyl chloride as the chiral resolving agent .	0

The treatment of morpholino benzoate ( 1a ) with a series of arylalanes indicated that the reaction is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the electronic eﬀect of the substituents on the aromatic ring of arylalanes. The electron - rich aryl-substituted alanes were eﬀective , aﬀording the corresponding products 3aa − ad in high yields.

ABSTRACT : A series of thienylphenothiazine decorated carbazoles were synthesized and characterized by optical , electrochemical , thermal , and theoretical investigations. Ab- sorption spectra of the compounds are inﬂuenced by the substitution pattern and chromophore number density. Compounds containing 2,7-substitution exhibited red - shifted absorption , while the chromophore loading on the other positions led to the increment in molar extinction coeﬃcients due to the increase in the chromophore density. Multiple substitutions resulted in twisting of chromophores and aﬀected the π-electrons , which the conjugative delocalization of produced shorter wavelength absorption for the 2,3,6,7- tetrasubstituted derivative. the compounds exhibited excited - state solvatochromism attributable to the structural reorganization - induced electronic perturbations. The solvatochromic data are supportive of a general solvent eﬀect , which is further conﬁrmed by Lippert − Mataga correlation. End- capping with butterﬂy shaped phenothiazine restrained the formation of molecular aggregates in the solid state. All of the compounds displayed exceptional thermal stability attributable to the rigid carbazole building block. Solution processed OLED fabricated using the new materials as emitting dopants in 4,4′-bis(9H-carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl host exhibited bluish green electroluminescence .	0

In 2011 , Corelli and co-workers17b reported the synthesis of 3-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one 9a through the reaction of 3-iodo- 1-methylquinolin-4(1H)-one 4 with phenylboronic acid 8a ( 1.2 equiv ) using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst ( 10 mol % ) , PPh3 as the ligand ( 30 mol % ) in the presence of Na2CO3 ( 2.0 M in H2O , 2.5 equiv ) in DME / EtOH ( 1.5 : 1 ) under microwave irradiation at 70 ° C for 5 min. 3-Phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one 9a was obtained in 75 % isolated yield. On the basis of this protocol , we performed the reaction of 4 with phenylboronic acid 8a ( 1.5 equiv ) in water at 100 ° C using sodium carbonate ( 1.0 equiv ) as the base and Pd(OAc)2 ( 5 mol % ) as the catalyst under ohmic heating using TBAB ( 0.1 equiv ) as the phase transfer catalyst ( PTC ). PTC has long been recognized as a versatile methodology for organic synthesis in industry , academia , and in process chemistry and is particularly suitable when substrates are insoluble in the reaction medium , as is the case of 1- substituted-3-iodoquinolin-4(1H)-ones 4 and 6.18 Under these conditions , 3-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one 9a was obtained in 75 % isolated yield after 30 min reaction time ( Table 1 , entry 1 ). An extensive optimization of the reaction parameters led us to study ( i ) the eﬀect of using the PTC ( TBAB addition ) , ( ii ) the eﬀect of Pd catalyst addition , and ( iii ) the reaction time. The base , solvent , and temperature used remained unchanged. Using the model reaction depicted in Table 1 , our initial investigations focused on studying the eﬀect of the PTC ( Table 1 , entries 1 and 2 ). A lower yield ( 61 % ) was obtained without the addition of PTC ( TBAB ) , demonstrating that TBAB plays an important role in the eﬃciency of this ligand - free protocol in water. Product 9a was isolated in very good yield ( 80 % ) when the reaction was performed without the addition of Pd(OAc)2 under ohmic heating ( Table 1 , entry 3 ) , but no product was found when the reaction was performed under classical heating conditions without Pd(OAc)2 ( Table 1 , entry 4 ). This result highlights that some contamination of the reaction medium with the palladium catalyst probably comes from the electrodes ( made of 316 stainless steel ) used in ohmic heating in the ﬁrst assay and that such a small quantity of palladium seems to be suﬃcient to give the coupling product in very good yield.

We then performed a series of reactions to evaluate the necessity of each reaction component ( Table 2 ).

Although we initially carried out the coupling reactions for 18 h , because the oxalate substrates were not amenable to TLC analysis , the yield of 5 was nearly identical when the reaction was run for only 2 h ( entries 1 and 2 ). Visible light proved to be essential for reactivity , as no conversion of oxalate 3a was observed when the reaction was conducted in the dark ( entry 3 ). Omission of Hantzsch ester 4 also resulted in complete recovery of 3a ( entry 4 ). In contrast , we observed signiﬁcant product formation in the absence of the photocatalyst ( entries 5 and 6 ).

47 % yield and was determined to have only 33 % deuterium incorporation ( at C2 of the butanone side chain ). 16 This result contrasts sharply with the essentially complete deuterium incorporation observed in the related coupling of the corresponding N-phthalimidoyl oxalate.6 As the protic acid generated by oxidation of dideutero Hantzsch ester 23 would be a mixture of protio and deuterio species , the low level of deuterium incorporation in product 9 ( eq 4 ) is consistent with signiﬁcant termination by the two - step electron transfer / protonation sequence .	0
We started our work with the development of a method for the preparation of 1a as a model for the exploration of the desired oxidative C − N bond formation. This compound was easily made in two steps , starting with the Claisen reaction of 1- phenylpiperidin-2-one ( 3a ) and ethyl 4-methoxybenzoate6 to obtain dicarbonyl 4a in good yield.7 There are a few isolated examples in the literature for the transformation of similar 1,3- dicarbonyls into ring - opened derivatives such as 1.8 Gratify- ingly , the reaction of 4a with benzylhydrazine provided 1a in 71 % yield on a 2 g scale ( Scheme 2 ). 9	0

To ﬁnd suitable conditions for ether / ﬂavone coupling , ﬂavone 4a and 1,4-dioxane were used as the representative reactants. Diﬀerent catalysts , oxidants , and solvents were screened. The coupling conditions used for coumarins and ethers also worked well for the coupling of ﬂavone with 1,4- dioxane. This reaction gave a 65 % yield of product 5a ( Table 3 , entry 1 ).

Under these new conditions , we also discovered a profound dependence of rate upon the nature of the N - substituent ( aryl vs alkyl ) and report a combined experimental and theoretical mechanistic study of this eﬀect .	0
According to our previous study,10 amphiphile 1 , which has a ﬂuorine content ( 13.8 % ) of less than 30 % should have a high aqueous solubility. Indeed , 1 is freely soluble in water , and therefore , no formulation of 1 is required for downstream imaging and toxicity studies. An 19F NMR study on an aqueous solution of amphiphile 1 was then carried out ( Figure 2 ). As expected , 1 gave a sharp singlet 19F NMR peak in deuterated chloroform from its 48 symmetrical ﬂuorines. However , only a weak 19F NMR signal was detected from its aqueous solution. Such a phenomenon is usually an indication of short relaxation times , which can “ turn oﬀ ” the 19F NMR signal.11 In fact , a transverse relaxation time of 1 ( T2 = 4.7 ms ; see short Supporting Information , Figure S1 ) in water was found. There are a few reports on the self - assembly of amphiphilic conjugated π-molecules in water where π-stacking and hydrophobic interactions are the driving forces.12 Therefore , the short T2 of 1 is probably a result of its self - assembly into supermolecular structures. To “ turn on ” the 19F NMR signal , it is necessary to tune the self - assembly by modifying the chemical two strategies were employed to tune the self - assembly : ( 1 ) breaking the molecular coplanarity by hydrogenation of the triple bonds in 1 to relieve the π-stacking and ( 2 ) increasing the hydrophilicity of 1 by introducing additional PEG units .	0
desired β-aryl amines were obtained with similar eﬃciencies ( entries 10 and 11 ). this protocol could be extended to ketones bearing heteroaromatic moieties ; however , the resulting β-aryl amines from these ketones were obtained with slightly lower enantioselectivities than those of simple benzyl methyl ketone derivatives ( entries 12 − 14 ). When this protocol could not be extended to other benzyl alkyl ketones other than benzyl methyl ketones , the reactivity in this transformation dramatically decreased with the size of the alkyl group.13 When benzyl ketones bearing a diﬀerent alkyl group were subjected to the standard conditions , no formation of the desired product was observed and the ketones remained unreacted even after long reaction times.14 To demonstrate the practicality of this method , a gram - scale reaction was carried out. Delightfully , this transformation was successfully performed on a 10 mmol scale to produce the desired β-aryl amine 4h with a similar eﬃciency. Furthermore , the catalyst loading could be reduced to 1 mol % without sacriﬁcing the eﬃcacy of this transformation ( Scheme 2 ) .	0

that proposed to account for the isomerization of retinals,13 would provide a reactive γ,δ-Z-diastereomer of the trienone 1a substrate. Strain could then force the polyene chain to a conformation in which it is dissected into two 4πe− moieties. Intramolecular [ π4a + π4s ] cycloaddition would then aﬀord cyclopenta[b]furan product 3a. 1H NMR monitoring of these reactions carried out in toluene-d8 at 100 ° C showed no evidence of any of the proposed intermediates. DFT calculations at the M06 / 6-31+G** level of theory were then performed to assess the feasibility of the proposed pathway ( Scheme 3 and Supporting Information ; for other DFT functionals , also see Supporting Information ). 14 Overall , the bicyclization of substrate 1a into cyclopenta[b]furan isomer 3a takes six elementary steps and liberates 7.8 kcal / mol of Gibbs free energy : ( i ) conversion of s-trans / s-trans E / E 1a into the s- cis / s-trans E / E isomer A ; ( ii ) oxa-6π electrocyclization to give 2a ; ( iii ) retro oxa-6π leading to the s-cis / s-trans Z / E isomer B ; ( iv ) conversion of B into the s-trans / s-trans Z / E isomer C ; ( v ) formation of the s-trans / s-cis Z / E isomer D ; and ( vi ) [ π4a + π4s ] cycloaddition giving rise to the ﬁnal product 3a. As shown by the lengths of the forming C − O and C − C bonds in TS D-3a ( 2.68 and 1.94 Å respectively ) , the construction of the two rings occurs in an asynchronous fashion in favor of the cyclopentene framework. This last step is the rate determining ‡ one ( ΔG 298 = 28.1 kcal / mol ) .	0

diﬀering reactivity are required. Grubbs and co-workers14 have divided alkenes in four categories based on their ability to form homodimers in CM reactions. Type I alkenes undergo rapid homodimerization , and these can participate in an ensuing CM event. Type II alkenes undergo slow homodimerization leading to homodimers that can participate in CM to a limited extent. Type III alkenes do not form homodimers , but they are able to react with type I and II homodimers in a CM. Type IV alkenes are essentially “ spectators to cross-metathesis ” as they do not display any activity toward the catalyst. For a selective CM , the reaction partners are preferably from diﬀerent types. The two allylic alcohols at hand are classiﬁed as type II CM partners , making the desired CM reaction a challenging process. To discriminate between the reactivity of the alkenes , we ﬁrst decided to protect the long chain alcohol 7a ( generating a type III CM partner ) , and we masked the hydroxyl group as a benzoyl ester ( 7b ) , a tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether ( 7c ) , a p- methoxybenzyl ( PMB ) ether ( 7d ) , or methoxymethyl ( MOM ) ether ( 7e ). The results of the CM reactions are summarized in Table 1. The ﬁrst attempt , involving diol 6a and alcohol 7a , provided the desired CM 8a product in 23 % yield ( entry 1 ).

The results are summarized in Table 1. The use of THF , CH3CN , DMSO , 1,4-dioxane , toluene , and NMP as solvent furnished relatively low yield ( Table 1 , entries 1 − 6 ) whereas DMF was found to be more eﬀective compared	0
heated the combination of tert-butyl-2-ethyltetradecaneperox- oate and Selectﬂuor in a sealed tube to 120 ° C for 2 h. When the reaction was run in acetone , a 22 % yield of 3-ﬂuoropentadecane was obtained , whereas when the reaction was run in 50 : 50 acetone / water , only a 4 % of ﬂuorinated product was obtained. On the basis of these ﬁndings , Li proposed that ﬂuorine atom transfer from Selectﬂuor to alkyl radicals is unlikely to be involved in the Ag - catalyzed process. Selectﬂuor is reported to be unstable in water at high temperature , forming HF through reaction of the reagent and water.27 To examine this , we heated Selectﬂuor in acetone-d6 / D2O to 120 ° C in a sealed tube for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature , a sample was removed and examined by 1H NMR , showing that 80 % of the reagent decomposed to the deﬂuorinated chloromethyl derivative ( see Supporting Information ). This shows that the conditions of the experiment were likely not conducive to testing whether radicals can abstract a ﬂuorine atom from Selectﬂuor. In addition , if a Ag(II)−F intermediate was formed during the reaction , it can be present only in a catalytic amount ( at most ). During its formation , radicals are also generated in a catalytic amount , so the likelihood of a small amount of radical being ﬂuorinated by a small amount of Ag(II)−F in the presence of excess Selectﬂuor is unlikely.

When the reaction was run in acetone , a 22 % yield of 3-ﬂuoropentadecane was obtained , whereas when the reaction was run in 50 : 50 acetone / water , only a 4 % of ﬂuorinated product was obtained. On the basis of these ﬁndings , Li proposed that ﬂuorine atom transfer from Selectﬂuor to alkyl radicals is unlikely to be involved in the Ag - catalyzed process. Selectﬂuor is reported to be unstable in water at high temperature , forming HF through reaction of the reagent and water.27 To examine this , we heated Selectﬂuor in acetone-d6 / D2O to 120 ° C in a sealed tube for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature , a sample was removed and examined by 1H NMR , showing that 80 % of the reagent decomposed to the deﬂuorinated chloromethyl derivative ( see Supporting Information ). This shows that the conditions of the experiment were likely not conducive to testing whether radicals can abstract a ﬂuorine atom from Selectﬂuor. In addition , if a Ag(II)−F intermediate was formed during the reaction , it can be present only in a catalytic amount ( at most ). During its formation , radicals are also generated in a catalytic amount , so the likelihood of a small amount of radical being ﬂuorinated by a small amount of Ag(II)−F in the presence of excess Selectﬂuor is unlikely.

As the molecules of 1r further aggregate into a two- dimensional structure ( Figure 5a ) , and into a three - dimensional structure ( Figure 5b ) , one channel appears with cross-sectional areas of 5 × 3 Å2. This architecture is stabilized by multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonds : C − H···π and π − π interactions with distances of 3.482[C3−H···Cg(C24 > C29 ) ] , 3.571[C30− H···Cg(C2 > C6 ) ] , 3.572[C30−H···Cg(C9 > C14 ) ] , and 3.368[Cg(C9 > C14)···Cg(C9 > C14 ) , and further strengthened by the existence of internal disorder from ethyl acetate via van der Waals interactions. Although 1r possesses the same crystal system ( monoclinic ) and the same space group ( P21 / c ) as those of 1l , a , b , and c values are totally diﬀerent ( Table 3 ) .	0
A mass action approximation can be used to relate the observed chemical shift δ obs and the total surfactant molar concentration c to the molar concentration at which micelles or aggregates begin to form , loosely deﬁned as the cmc , and the chemical shift of the free surfactant monomer δ m and the chemical shift of the micellar or aggregated phase δ a ( eq 1 ). 36 ( 1 ) obs against 1 / c for perﬂuorononanamide in liquid ammonia consists of two linear segments that intersect at 1 / c = 1 / cmc ( Figure 2 ) , and these derived cmc values for various perﬂuorinated alkyl amides are given in Table 1.

In order to make a comparison of the structures of 6 − 8 present in solution and various theoretical as well as experimental geometries , we computed the 13C NMR chemical shifts39 using the GIAO- MP2 / cc-pVTZ-method.40 For parent 6 and diﬂuoro derivative 8 experimental 13C NMR chemical shifts are available and our computations for the MP2 / cc-pVTZ-geometries yield correla- tion coeﬃcients R2 between experiment and theory of greater than 0.99.

NMR data for the X-ray diﬀraction geometries were computed for the exper- imentally found C1 point group ( using the Cartesian coordinates for the heavy atoms from the crystal structure and adding the hydrogens in idealized positions ) and were averaged according to Cs - symmetry constraints. Although the computed values are systematically too large , the overall agreement for the computed geometries is excellent , apparently implying a very similar geometry for 7 in solution and in the gas phase ( cf.

A large number of cellular recognition events involve specific interactions between particular classes of the carbohydrate structures on one cell surface and the receptor proteins on another cell surface.' The importance of carbohydrate recognition is evident from the fact that ca. 70 % of antibodies obtained upon immunization with whole cells are directed against oligosaccharide structures.2 Complex carbohydrate recognition by protein re- ceptors plays an essential role in immunology , cell adhesion , and fertilization ? Additionally , the transport of carbohydrates through lipophilic membranes into the cell , which in several cases is ATP - independent and selective for only one type of carbohydrate ? involves a carbohydrate transporter protein , which is embedded in the cell membrane. This protein binds the saccharide from the blood and transports it into the cytoplasm .	0
Abstract : Membrane - disrupting bolaphiles I [HO(CH2CH20)6CO(CHz),4C02(CH2CH,0)6H] and 111 [ HO(CH2CH20)6- CO(CH2)6CH = CH(CH2)6C02(cH2cH20)6H ] , and IV ( -[CO(CH2)6CH = CH(CH2)6c02(cH2cH20) 13 ] 5,7- ) , show high selectivity toward lipid bilayers of varying cholesterol content. In the absence of cholesterol , these surfactants are effective in inducing the release of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein , entrapped within liposomes made from both egg PC and l-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( POPC ). The ability of I-IV to disrupt POPC bilayers that contain substantial amounts of cholesterol ( > 33 mol a ) , however , is significantly reduced. In contrast , Triton x -100 and a single - chain analogue of 11 ( i.e. , CH,(CH2)6C0z(CH2CH20)6H , v ) are relatively insensitive to the presence of cholesterol. Similar selectivity has been observed with biological targets , Le. , human erythrocytes and a human bacterium ( Proteus mirabilis ). These results provide the first clear evidence that modest and definable differences in membrane composition and packing can lead to large differences in lability , and that synthetic agents can be created which exploit such differences. The implications of these findings to the development of membrane - disrupting antimicrobial agents are briefly discussed .	0
Abstract : a-Urazolyl ketones are readily oxidized to acylated N-phenyltriazolinedione ylides with tert-butyl hypochlorite. These ylides , usually as generated in situ , undergo condensations with enolate species to form acylated olefins in synthetically useful yields. The ylide derived from deoxybenzoin is sufficiently stable to be isolated and characterized , and displays the same type of condensation chemistry with enolates as do other less stable ylides that must be generated in situ. The tri- and tetraacylolefins produced by this method are susceptible to subsequent Michael addition of enolates. Intramolecular cyclization or basic cleavage of these Michael adducts leads to a variety of interesting secondary products .	0

Ethoxide and 1-propoxide ions are preferable to methoxide and 2-propoxide ions for the formation of ipso adducts 3A. The combination of 1-bromo-1-(p-ethoxypheny1)ethene 1Ab and eth- oxide anion gave the best yield of ipso adduct 3Ab , which was isolated as crystals .	0
The torsional mode v I 0 gives rise to a distinct C - type band centered at 1095 cm-' and dominated by the Z isomer , which has a far higher calculated intensity than the E. The small spike seen at 1094 cm-' ( Figure Sb ) may or may not be due to the Q branch of 1E ; in the matrix this band is very weak and appears at 1075 cm-'. The average rotational spacing of the P and R branches is 3.1 cm-I , and the band shape and position are very similar to those for (Z)-l-pr0pyn-3-imine ~ ~ * ( 1094 cm-I ). The pure C - type structure of the band demonstrates the planarity of the molecule being observed .	0
Determining pKas becomes complicated when formation of higher order aggregates occurs. Recently , Streitwieser has at- tempted to attack this problem by measuring equilibrium acidities over a concentration range of about ( 0.6-10 ) X lo4 M.19 The information from these experiments yields pKas at different concentrations and an average aggregation number. Although the pK,s are concentration - dependent for higher order aggregates , approximate acidity values can be obtained since the variation does not usually exceed 1.5 pKa units. This technique has proven successful for a few compounds , but may have limitations as a general technique for lithium enolates due to rapid addition to the parent carbonyl compound .	0
Abstract : In analogy with alkyl iodides and bromides , the phenyl thio- and selenoethers 2a,b , 13a , 2lb,c and 35 displayed competing radical and ionic photobehavior on irradiation in solution , via a mechanism thought to involve initial homolytic cleavage of the alkyl C-S or C-Se bond followed by electron transfer within the resulting radical pair cage ( Scheme I ). These are the first examples of ionic photobehavior to be recognized for the C-SAr and C-SeAr chromophores. The electronegatively substituted pentafluorophenyl analogues 2c , 13b , and 21d displayed enhanced ionic photobehavior. By contrast , the 4- methoxyphenyl derivative 2la exhibited almost exclusively radical behavior. The sulfoxide ( 2R*,R* & 21f displayed principally radical behavior , accompanied by epimerization at sulfur. The quantum yields for the disappearance of the 2-norbornyl ethers 2lb and 2 l c were 0.53 - 0.64 in solution and rose to 0.89 - 0.95 in the presence of suspended fumed silica. Irradiation of the phenyl thioether 21b on silica gel resulted in nucleophilic trapping by surface silanol groups to afford covalently bound material ( 3 3 , which afforded chloride 34 on treatment with S0Cl2. Irradiation of phenyl thioethers 2a and 35 , phenyl selenoether 2b , or C6HSSH in allyl alcohol solution afforded acetal 11 , apparently via isomerization of some of the solvent to propanal ( 44 ) followed by acetalization.

Experiments were also carried out without the addition of chiral seed crystals during the recrystallization of l b from ethanol. Of great interest , the crystals of l b obtained by ordinary recrys- tallization afforded (-)-2b 15 out of 17 times in high enantiomeric excess ( 85-100 % ) upon photoirradiation for 1 h. Therefore , from the present result , it can be concluded that the seeding of chiral crystals is not necessary for the amplification of asymmetry , but only for obtaining chiral crystals of the intended optical rotation. Such a significant one sided generation of chirality may be induced by a trace amount of one of the enantiomers or some other chiral nucleating agent in our laboratory. A differential scanning thermogram of Ib showed two endo- thermic peaks at 112 and at 120 ' C. The crystal ( designated as form a ) , which gave the optically active dimer 2b by irradiation , when annealed at 112 OC for 5 min and then slowly cooled to 40 O C , melted at 120 'C and showed only one DSC peak. This result implies that a metastable crystal ( form a ) is transformed by a melting process into a stable one ( form p ) , which was not obtained by recrystallization from solvent. Crystals of form / 3 were pho- tostable. These two dimorphs showed remarkably different in- frared spectra and powder diffraction patterns .	0
Abstract : Phycocyanobilin dimethyl ester ( 3 ) undergoes a self - sensitized oxidation by a singlet oxygen [02('AJ] mechanism with a quantum yield of 1 @ 106 , depending on the solvent , excitation wavelength , and concentration. The main photooxidation products are a tripyrrolic aldehyde ( 7 ) and three stereoisomeric peroxides ( 8-10 ) formed from two units of 3. Near-IR emission of 02('A,) - formed upon sensitization by 3 under both steady - state irradiation and pulsed excitation - constitutes the first direct evidence for the intersystem crossing of a bilatriene. The low photooxidation yield results from a low intersystem crossing < IO4 , estimated by the energy - transfer method in flash photolysis. A total rate constant of k = ( 3.4 f yield from 3 , 0.3 ) X 108 M-' s-' was determined for the quenching of 02 ( 1 $ ) by 3. Possible relations between these findings and the piotophobic movement of Anabaena variabilis are discussed. In analogy to biliverdin dimethyl ester , two types of conformations ( a helical form and a family of stretched forms ) for 3 [ and for its 3,3'-dihydro-3'-thioethoxy derivatives (3'5'*)-5 ] were detected in methanol at room temperature by stationary fluorescence and excitation spectra. The wavelength dependence of the self - sensitized photooxidation of 3 is due to the selective reaction of the helical conformer , while a selective photoisomerization of the stretched forms of 3 and 5 was observed by time - resolved laser - induced optoacoustic spectroscopy. For 3 the latter process takes place with a quantum yield > 0.5 , and the resulting isomer ( probably a '2-10 stereoisomer of the parent compound ) reverts to the ground state with a lifetime of around 200 ns .	0

Aldol Condensation with Benzaldehyde. Incubation of L-ky- nurenine and excess benzaldehyde with kynureninase from P. fluorescens ( ATCC 1 1250)4 , under the conditions described by Bild and Morris : resulted in 2-amino-4-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoic acid ( eq 2 ) , which was purified by preparative HPLC in nearly quantitative yield based on L-kynurenine. This product exhibited a circular dichroism ( CD ) spectrum with a negative extremum at 260 nm , exhibiting vibronic splitting characteristic of a chirally substituted benzyl alcohol chromophore. Comparison of this CD spectrum with those of (R)- and @ )-mandelic acids demonstrated that the major enzymatic aldol product exhibits the same absolute configuration as (S)-mandelic acid , and thus has the 4R config- ration.^ However , the 300-MHz IH N M R spectrum of this product demonstrates that it is a 4 : l mixture of diastereomers , with the major signals assigned to the 2S,4R isomer of 2- amino-4-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoic acid ( Figure 1 A ) : Although the reaction of benzaldehyde with L-alanine could also lead to the aldol product , the incubation of L-alanine and benzaldehyde in the presence of kynureninase does not result in any significant aldol reaction , in agreement with Bild and Morris.*	0
Sorai et a1.4 proposed that the magnetic behavior of 2 can only be explained by a level crossing of : two close - lying MOs , a non- degenerate a i and a doubly degederate e ’ ( under assumed D3h symmetry ). Unfortunately , their proposed temperature - dependent energy scheme was flawed by the assignment of an incorrect number of electrons ( i.e. , four instead of two ) to the frontier a ; and e ’ MOs. Frisch and Dah15 likewise rationalized the ‘ H NMR singlet - triplet data in terms of a crossover of the a i and e ’ energy levels , with the a ; level lower and doubly occupied at low tem- peratures ( in accordance with the singlet state ) and the e ’ levels lower and doubly occupied at high temperatures ( in accordance with the triplet state ). In harmony with Sorai et a1. : Frisch and Dah15 speculated that this change in electronic structure may be primarily a consequence of the metal-Cp interactions due to a vibronic effect caused by more restricted Cp motion at lower temperatures .	0
We have prepared poly(p-quaterphenylene-2,2'-dicarboxylic acid ) ( I ) by an adaptation of a Pd(0) cross coupling of boronic acids and aryl halidesI4 ( eq 1 ). Following its synthesis , polymer I is readily isolated by addition of dilute hydrochloric acid to yield the free acid form as a golden solid. While the free acid is completely insoluble in all common organic solvents , I may be dissolved in dilute aqueous base as its sodium , potassium , or triethylammonium salt. We note that , in contrast to these mo- novalent cations , addition of divalent magnesium or zinc salts causes immediate precipitation of I to yield solvent and water- resistant , insoluble films. Concentrated solutions of I ( > 5 % w / v ) can be prepared in basic aqueous dimethylformamide ( 75 : 25 , water / DMF ). Liquid crystallinity has not yet been observed in solutions of I ; however , thin films cast from concentrated solutions of I are highly birefringent , confirming the polymer 's anisotropic structure .	0

Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering 21 0-41 California Institute of Technology Pasadena , California 91 125 Received May 9 , 1991 The design of synthetic molecules capable of recognizing given chemical entities in a specific and predictable manner is of great fundamental and practical importance.' The principal paradigm of the molecular design of such materials involves the preorgan- ization of binding sites of the host system ( receptor ) around complementary binding sites of the guest molecule ( substrate ). 2 Wulff and co-workers devised a novel approach to synthesizing substrate - selective polymers that consists of covalent linking of polymerizable groups around a template molecule and subsequent cross-linking polymerization of the resulting a ~ sembly. ~ The orientations of the binding sites of the template molecules sculpt the substrate - selective architecture of the templated polymers. Here we report a novel variation of this template polymerization technique to synthesize rigid macroporous polymers containing strategically distributed Cu(I1) - imincdiacetate ( CuI'IDA ) com- plexes. The resulting polymers exhibit selectivity for bisimidazole uprotein analogues " that are not distinguishable by reverse - phase HPLC .	0
Substrate recognition and selective binding abilities of the templated polymers were determined by both saturation rebinding and competitive rebinding experiments with substrates 2 and 3 ( Table 11 ). While the templated polymers exhibit selectivity for their templates over the close structural analogue ( entries 7 and 12 in Table 11 ) , polymer P-1 prepared without template exhibits essentially no selectivity ( entry 3 ). The separation factors of 1.15 - 1.17 for the templated polymers are significant in view of the fact that substrates 2a and 3a are indistinguishable by re- verse - phase HPLC and ligand - exchange chromatography on Cu " IDA. One can expect significantly higher selectivities for less similar substrates .	0
7421 An important consequence of the nucleophilic character of 3 is the ability of its oxo ligands to displace halides from other metals to form heterobimetallic p-oxo complexes.

Also illustrated are the addition of [Cp*WO,]- to the electrophilic carbyne carbon of [ Cp(CO),Re = CTol]+ to form the bimetallic carbene complex 13 and the oxidation of 11 to form 12.

1,3-Nonadiynyl units were combined with N-methyl , N-propyl , and N-pentylgluconamides to attain the amphiphiles 1-3. The L-gluconamide 4 was also prepared. 2 and 3 are stable , colorless compounds whereas compound 1 soon turned red due to partial polymerization ( Amax : 529 , 575 nm ). Gluconamides 1-4 were insoluble in water at room temperature , but readily dissolved upon refluxing. Rapid cooling to room temperature produced a whitish gel with compound 1 in the concentration range of OS-10 % v / w , whereas 2 , 3 , and 4 gave white , viscous dispersions.

As the individual titles suggest , the emphasis of these two volumes is different. Specific topics such as antiinflammatory , analgesic , antimi- crobial , anticarcinogenic , and radioprotective effects of particular copper complexes as well as copper complexes in nutrition are covered at length in Biology ofcopper Complexes.

seemed a likely candidate to effect the hydrolysis of urea. In the present report we describe the synthesis of a related dinuclear nickel complex containing a unique bridging urea molecule. Upon heating , this complex effects the hydrolysis of urea by a pathway involving cyanate ion that is distinct from that previously proposed for the enzyme. These results provide the first direct evidence for a mechanism long considered as an alternative for the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea.9a,b	0

The complexation of nucleic acid components by synthetic receptors is an important target of supramolecular chemistry.1 In most cases the complexation is predominantly based on ion pairing with phosphate groups ; 2 complexes with neutral nucleosides or with nucleobases3 rely on stacking interactions on hydrogen bonds , or on both , and are usually weaker as well as most often restricted to the use of lipophilic solvents. We wish to report on a new host compound , which allows for the first time to complex both natural nucleosides and nucleotides and does so in water with hitherto unknown large affinities with both biologically important substrate classes .	0
Abstract The preparation of fullerenes Cso to C2 & in very high yield ( up to 44 % extractable ) by a plasma discharge is reported. Almost one - third of the extractable material is composed of giant fullerenes CS4 to C200. An extraction scheme for isolating selected molecular weight fractions of fullerenes is described. The extractions were characterized by time - of - flight mass spectrometry and Fourier transform mass spectrometry. We find that a Soxhlet extraction with benzene extracts 50 % more soluble fullerenes than benzene reflux. Soxhlet extractions with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene preferentially extract higher molecular weight fullerenes. Hexane appears to limit the amount of higher fullerenes extracted , giving solutions containing Cbo and C70 with only small traces of the higher molecular weight fullerenes. Heptane extraction following the hexane extraction appears to preferentially extract Cbo , C70 , and CS4. This solvent scheme is useful in preparing selected molecular weight fractions for subsequent separation by column chromatography .	0

5 , 6a,c and l a would be required to evaluate mixing of the C = O / C-N modes. The '*O isotopic data at hand indicate that the C = O stretching mode is coupled with some other modes in 5 , 6c , and 7a but there is a disturbing insensitivity of Y to that - isotopic substitution that could be taken as evidence for changes in the C = O / C-N interaction resulting from resonance. What can be ascertained from the peak positions given in Table I1 is some evidence consistent with a resonance model. Thus , for the good resonance amides 5 and 6c , the C = O and C-N bands are closer together than is the case for the poor resonance amides 6c and 7c. This is in accordance with expectations based upon changes in the amount of double bond character. Also , the CHCl , cast or gas - phase u C 4 data for 4a , and 3a-d given in Table I appear quite consistent with the resonance model , but they are not inconsistent with the Wiberg7Job and BaderIob model , which should increase with rotation around the also indicates uc4 N-C(0)	0

The catalytic hydrogenation of metallocene dihalide 9b bearing phenylalkenyl substituents at the Cp rings took place smoothly on a heterogeneous platinum catalyst at elevated pressure ( € ’to2 , 50 bar of H2 ) in dichloromethane solution at ambient temperature. Under these conditions , both phenyl ring systems were hydro- genated in addition to the C = C double bonds to give the cyclo- hexyl-substituted [ Cp-CH(CH3)Cyl2ZrCI2 diastereoisomers meso-1 and rac-1 in a nearly 1 : 1 ratio ( isolated in almost quan- titative yield ) .	0
Abstract : Ionic conductivities of the complexes of polystyrene with pendant penta[oligo(oxyethylene)]cyclotriphosphazenes ( poly(SDEP) , (-OCH2CH2),0CH3 , n = 2 ; poly(STEP) , n = 3 ) with LiC104 were investigated as a function of temperature and salt concentration. The glass transition temperatures ( TJ of side chains of poly(SDEP) and poly(STEP) were observed at -62 and -67 " C , respectively. Interestingly , the Tg values of the poly(STEP)-Li salt complexes of [Li+] / O > 0.5 become higher than those of the poly(SDEP)-Li salt system. The conductivities of the complexes exhibit a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence , indicating an ion transport in the amorphous phase. In spite of the low segmental mobility of poly(STEP)-Li salt complexes , their conductivities are higher than those of the poly(SDEP) system and the maximum conductivities of 1.1 X IO-'S / cm at 60 " C and 5.1 X 104S / cm at 100 " C have been achieved at [Li+] / O = 0.05. The high conductivities might be explained by an ion transport through a continuous conducting phase consisting of a number of oxyethylene chains without being affected by the mobility of the backbone. This implies that the flexibility of backbone is not an important factor to achieve a high conductivity. From the correlation between the polymer characteristics and the conductivity , the conduction appears to occur at a rate governed by both the mobility of side chains and the stability of the complex , which relates with ion - dipole interactions .	0
On the basis of prior work from our laboratory , we were op- timistic that the hydroboration of olefin 42b would proceed se- lectively to establish the C4 stereocenter with the desired sense Treatment of 42b with thexylborane of asymmetric ( Scheme XI ) followed by an oxidative workup produced a mixture of alcohols , 43a and its C4 epimer , in a ratio of 84 : 16 as determined by capillary GC analysis. After chromatographic separation , the desired isomer was isolated in 79 % yield. Since other diol- protected substrates afforded the same sense of asymmetric in- duction in this reaction , the assignment of the C4 stereochemical relationship in 43a was made by analogy .	0
Abstract : The Diels - Alder reactions of 1-(Gmethy1mandeloxy)butadiene and its analogues , bearing a remote stereogenic center , have been studied to elucidate the stereoselective control elements. Several model dienes ( sa-5f ) have been designed to enhance the facial selectivity at room temperature. The design concept of these dienes is based on our proposed perpendicular model ( Siegel , C. ; Thornton , E. R Tetrahedron Lett. 1988 , 29 , 5225-5228 ) , which we used to rationalize the diastereofacial preference observed with diene 1. Our approach to increasing the diastereoselectivity was to enhance the population of the preferred diene rotamer in the ground state as well as in the transition structure. From X-ray structures of the cycloadducts and the reversal of facial selectivity with dienes having a free hydroxy group at the chiral center , we conclude that dieneilienophile coordination through hydrogen bonding plays an important role in promoting chirality transfer. We postulate that facial selectivity is controlled by a balance of two competing forces ( stereoelectronics vs hydrogen bonding ) on the diene conformation in the transition structure. Conformational tuning at the stereogenic center helped in designing a diene ( Se ) , which aims at maximizing the hydrogen - bonding interaction by decreasing the stereoelectronic preference. This diene exhibited high diastereoselectivity with an array of dienophiles at ca. 25 OC , without employing any external catalyst .	0

As expected , the radical chain process ( Schemes I and 11 ) does not operate to any significant degree in the matrix - phase photolysis of dioxirane 1 ( Table 11 ; entry 4 ). Already noted was the high yield ( 41 % ) of the coupling product CH3CF , , but also the lack of the symmetrical esters , Le. , methyl acetate ( 3a ) and tri- fluoromethyl trifluoroacetate ( 3d ) , is of mechanistic relevance. Therefore , the ester products 3a,b may arise either by rear- rangement of the dioxyl diradical 2 ( eq 1 ) or by @ -scission followed by in-cage coupling of the resulting acetyloxy and methyl radical pairs ( eq 2 ) .	0
Abstract : A variety of hexacyclen derivatives with aliphatic substituents have been prepared and characterized via X-ray diffraction , calorimetry , thermogravimetric analysis , and computer simulations. A subset of these compounds ( Za and 2e ) are seen to display a liquid crystalline mesophase , while others transform directly from the crystalline to the isotropic liquid phase. The merits of tubular and smectic liquid crystalline models for the mesophase structure are discussed .	0

Abstract : The enthalpies of hydrolysis of the monocyclic lactones from y-butyrolactone to tridecanolactone were determined calorimetrically , and the acyclic ethyl esters having the same number of atoms were studied in the same fashion. The enthalpies of reduction of the lactones to the corresponding a,w - alkanediols with lithium triethylborohydride also were determined. The enthalpies of formation of the lactones and the ethyl esters were derived from these data. They were converted to values for the gas phase by measuring the enthalpies of vaporization of ethyl esters and of lactones. In the cases of y-butyrolactone and 6-valerolactone , the enthalpies of formation were in good accord with the previously reported values determined via combustion calorimetry. The strain energies of the lactones were obtained via isodesmic reactions. Valerolactone had a strain energy of 11 kcal / mol , and the largest strain energy was found with wtanolactone ( 13 kcal / mol ). The conformations of y-butyrolactone and 6-valerolactone were studied via MP2 / 6-31 G* geometry optimizations , and the conformations of the other lactones were studied with use of the molecular mechanics program MM3. The energies of the lactones estimated via molecular mechanics were compared with the experimental results .	0
In prior papers of this series , we have reported studies of host - guest complexes bound to one another by polar attractions ( e.g. , hydrogen bonding , ion pairing , ion dipole , dipole - dipole , metal ligating ) , ’ and by steric repulsions in which guests are fully incarcerated in rigidly hollow hosts ( carceple ~ es ). ~ Here we report the syntheses of the new host 1 , the first hemicarcerand , whose rigidly hollow shell contains a portal through which guests can enter and depart the inner phase by thermally overcoming the steric constraints imposed by the size and shape of the guest , and those of the portal and the attractions of the inner phase. We propose the term constrictive binding to apply to the steric re- pulsions that must be overcome for dissociation of a hemicarceplex. The first section describes the syntheses of hemicarceplexes Isguest ( 1.G ) and 2-(CH3),NCHO , hemicarcerand 1 , ana car- ceplexes I(CH3)2S0 and 4 .( CH3)2S0.

( cytochrome P-450 vs hemerythrin ). 1 ° Compounds with bridging oxygens are known for all of the transition elements ( e & the binary oxides ) , but terminal oxo complexes are common only for metals in the center - left area of the transition series. " The large majority of stable terminal oxo complexes have high metal oxi- dation states ( 1 + 4 ) and low d electron counts ( do , dl , or d2 ) in order to allow the oxygen p r electrons to donate into empty metal d r orbitals. " In low oxidation states , multiple bonding becomes unfavorable as electrons occupy metal d r orbitals ( the metal- oxygen r-antibonding orbitals ) and oxo-bridged structures ( M- 0-M ) with single bonds become dominant.

Department of Chemistry and the Center of Fundamental Materials Research Michigan State University East Lansing , Michigan 48824 Received May 28 , 1991 Despite the extensive inventory of homoleptic metal / poly- chalcogenide complexes known , there are no examples of corre- sponding actinide complexes. The high oxophilicity of these metals precludes the use of solvents such as dimethylformamide commonly used to synthesize other metal / chalcogenide complexes. However , the molten salt synthetic technique has been well - demonstrated to provide a low - temperature route to new , meta-stable compounds , especially in ternary systems of alkali metal / transition - metal / chalcogenides.'S2 As part of our continuing effort to explore the utility of this technique ( which does not require common organic solvents ) and to extend polychalcogenide chemistry to actinides , we have examined the reactivity of uranium in these melts. We report here the facile synthesis of the potassium salt of [ U(Se2)4J ' , the first uranium polyselenide complex. Synthesized at 300 OC , K4USe8 is a molecular compound in which exist discrete anions of uranium coordinated to four q2-Se2'- ligand^.^	0
The anaerobic oxidation of 2 with KMn04 gave a bis(p- oxo)manganese(III,llI) complex ( 3 ) ( Scheme I ). In a typical experiment , the colorless solution of 2 was stirred with 4 equiv of KMn04 for 2 days in toluene. Unreacted KMn04 was removed by filtration , and the dark - red filtrate was evacuated to dryness under vacuum. Recrystallization of the resultant solid from pentane afforded 3.C5H12 as dark red crystals in ca. 90 % yie1d.I ' The molecular structure of 3 is presented in Figure 2.Is There is no crystallographically imposed center of symmetry. The Mn-0 distances are in the range 1.79 - 1.81 A , which are typical Mn-0 bond distances for manganese-oxo bonds. The Mn-Mn separation of 2.70 A is also typical for the dinuclear complexes having a M n ( ~ - 0 ) ~ M n moiety. There are many examples of bis(p-oxo)- dimanganese complexes of Mn(II1,IV) and Mn(IV,IV) , whereas Mn(II1,III) complexes were not known until very recently.16 All these complexes contain six - coordinate manganese ions. On the other hand , the manganese ions in 3 are five - coordinate. This is attributable to the large steric hindrance of the present ligand. Complex 3 is EPR silent and gives a reasonably sharp 'H N M R spectrum at low temperature. These facts together with the low magnetic susceptibility ( 2.8 1 pB / mol ) suggest a strong antifer- romagnetic interaction between the two manganese(II1) ions in 3 as observed for other bis(p-oxo)manganese(III) complexes,I6 although the coordination geometry is not comparable. Complex 2 is also oxidatively converted to 3 under a dioxygen atmmphere. However , the yield to 3 was not very high ( the highest	0
cleavage , for example , has been proposed2 to proceed by electron transfer from the photodimer to the photoexcited quinone followed by sequential cleavage of the C6,C6 ’ and the CS,C5 ’ bonds of the photodimer and reduction of the uracil radical cation by the semiquinone radical ( Scheme I ). The only experimental evidence in support of this proposal is the observation of CIDNP in the product. ) With the view of developing mechanistic probes for the enzymatic reaction , we have synthesized a photodimer s u b stituted with a radical trap designed to block the quinone - sensitized photodimer fragmentation after the first CC bond cleavage .	0
Differential pulse voltammograms also exhibit well - defined anodic peaks associated with these irreversible oxidations ( Figure 1 b ). The peak current intensities are about 4 times that of each of the one - electron reductions.

evaluated unambiguously by inspection , and comparison with the simulated spectrum ( c ) shows the excellence of the fit. An ex- amination of these coupling constants ( Table I ) suggested ? + as a suitable candidate since the magnitudes of the hyperfine in- teractions are consistent with a structure possessing two nearly equivalent olefinic a-hydrogens , three nonequivalent B-hydrogens ! and one y-hydrogen. The latter coupling provided an especially important clue to the correct structure since the required long- range interaction is well characterized in bicyclic system^.^ As shown in Figure 1 , the spectrum ( b ) generated upon the oxidation of 3 matches spectrum a in all its fine detail , leaving no doubt that 3 " is the thermal rearrangement product .	0

( i ) less molecular dATP is obtained ; ( ii ) more dAMP is produced ; ( iii ) more phosphate and diphosphate are formed ; and ( iv ) less tripolyphosphate is observed ( not shown ; less than 4 % ). These trends are consistent with photochemical activation of the P U P bonds at intermediate and low vaporization power. The incident photon fluence ( -2 X 10'' photons cm-* s-I ) is high enough that this activation can proceed through a two - photon excitation of the 274-nm electronic absorption band of the phosphate'l or through an excitation of the adenine base with subsequent energy transfer to the phosphate bonds. Alternatively , the photon energy may degrade to thermal energy before vaporization occurs. This would result in a photothermal mechanism for cleaving the weak phosphodiester bond at low laser powers. At the highest powers , the P U P bonds are still activated , but the energy is most likely quenched by the high number of subsequent collisions .	0
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry University of Maryland , College Park , Maryland 20742 Received May 23 , 1991 Carbocyclic seven - membered rings are present in a variety of medicinally important compounds and are typically constructed by ring expansion reactions , cyclization reactions , reactions of other seven - membered rings , and occasionally cycloaddition reactions. Cycloaddition reactions have the greatest potential , but few leading to direct formation of a seven - membered ring have been reported.' To develop a seven membered ring forming cycloaddition reaction , the reaction between cyclopropylcarbene-chromium complexes and alkynes was examined ( Scheme I ). This reaction produced	0

The prepa- ration of allenic lactones such as 2 from 4 proved straightforward. For example , addition of phenylmagnesium bromide in ether at -78 OC to 4 followed by heating with catalytic tosic acid in benzene furnished the phenyl allenic lactone 2b in 55 % yield.5 Thus this is a good approach to allenic lactones of this sort .	0
Department of Chemistry , The Scripps Research Institute 10666 North Torrey Pines Road La Jolla , California 92037 Received April 26 , 1991 A major synthetic value of enzyme catalysis is its predictable stereoselectivity.2 A change of stereoselectivity , though very unusual , may occur , however , with different substrate str ~ ctures , ~ temperatures : or solvent^.^ These selectivity changes are often not very significant , with some exceptions ' where the enantiose- lectivity is inverted. In the case of enzymatic aldol reactions , the diastereofacial selectivity for the aldehyde component is often consistent and completely controlled by the enzyme as documented by numerous reactions catalyzed by fructose- 1,6-diphosphate aldolase6 and N-acetylneuraminic acid ( or sialic acid ) aldolase ' ( EC 4.1.3.3 ). We report here a complete reversal of stereose- lectivity in the sialic acid aldolase catalyzed reactions of pyruvate with L-mannose and with 6-deoxy- ~ -mannose ( L-rhamnose ) ( Scheme I ) .	0

Milliken et aLzo have used weight loss as an indicator of reactivity.

The well - established propensity of group 5 transition metals to induce reductive coupling and polymerization of isocya- nides10a,14 together with the fact that a highly reduced metal center should facilitate carbon-carbon bond formation between CNR molecules14a may explain the scarcity of low - valent vanadium isocyanides. In this article , we report on the chemistry of new thermally stable electron rich isocyanide complexes of vanadium. Of particular significance are the first paramagnetic zerovalent metal isocyanides , V(CNXyl)6 and trans-V(CO)2- (CNXyl)4 ( Xyl ) 2,6-dimethylphenyl ). Remarkably , the former 17-electron homoleptic compound is the only binary octahedral paramagnetic metal(0) complex for which well - resolved NMR spectra have been recorded.15 Analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR patterns , obtained for V(CNXyl)6 , in terms of unpaired spin delocalization is presented. Also described are the first 16- and 18-electron homoleptic isocyanide complexes of vanadium , namely [V(CNXyl)6]+ and [V(CNXyl)6]-. The latter ion and its tantalum congener , [Ta(CNXyl)6]-,9b constitute the first binary octahedral isocyanide metalates .	0

Malonyl Difluoride ( 1 ). Model calculations for a large number of conformations demonstrate that the experimental radial dis- tribution function ( Figure 6 ) can be reproduced reasonably well only with an S-gauche conformer. This finding confirms the result of the HF / 6-31G** calculations which predict this form to be lower in energy than the W-gauche conformation in contrast to the HF / 3-21G prediction. The agreement between experimental and calculated radial distribution functions is slightly improved if a small contribution of a W-gauche conformer with S(CCC0) around 135' is added. The inclusion of a small amount ( < lo % ) of a U-cis or U-gauche form does not lead to a further im- provement , and larger amounts of the latter deteriorate the fit. Therefore , only S-gauche and W-gauche conformers were con- sidered in the experimental analysis , although the ab initio cal- culations predict three stable structures. The preliminary structure model for the S-gauche form was then refined by a least - squares procedure of the molecular intensities. These were modified with a diagonal weight matrix and scattering amplitudes and phases of Haase were used.23 Both COF groups were assumed to have equal geometric parameters , except for the two dihedral angles. 6 ] was refined and J2 was set to zero. Vibrational amplitudes for closely spaced interatomic distances were collected in groups , and further constraints are evident from Table 111. All bond lengths ,	0
drazine relative conformational energies correctly , " and we need electronic as well as steric information for electron - transfer studies on these molecules. We have instead chosen to employ Dewar 's AM1 semiempirical MO method : which works exceptionally well for oxidized sesquibicyclic hydrazines.1 ° These molecules are too large ( 24 heavy atoms , 38 light ) for practical geometry optimi- zation with the QCPE version of the program , but Clark 's con- siderably faster and improved vectorized VAMP program " allows complete geometry optimization without imposing any symmetry. Table I shows calculated energies for the conformations of Scheme 11. Many distances and bond angles of rather similar sizes are involved in causing the energy differences between different conformations , and we are unable to pick out a few that allow rationalizing the energy differences in a simple manner .	0
The major problem with the solution - phase reactions was the rapid ene reaction of the initially formed cyclopropenes. It seemed possible to circumvent the problem by carrying out the dehalo- genation in the gas phase and trapping the product as an argon matrix at 20 K. This procedure has been successful in the for- mation of o- and p-xylyleneM and of several small ring propellanes that undergo rapid polymerization when the argon matrix softens at 50 K. " The reaction of 13 with potassium atoms in an argon stream was carried out in the same fashion as for the preparation of the propellanes. The infrared spectrum of the argon matrix showed norcarane , the reduction product from 13 , and a small amount of methylenecyclohexene. No bands that could reasonably be attributed to 4 were found. The dibromide , 11 , gave the same products in roughly the same proportion. Complete reduction products are commonly formed in reactions of this type , and norcarane was an expected product. However , it was surprising to find methylenecyclohexene .	0

When an oxygen - free matrix of 3 was allowed to warm slowly to room temperature , a white crystalline compound , mp 210-210.5 OC , shown by mass spectrometry to be a tetramer of 1 , could be isolated in 84 % yield. The structure of this compound was shown by single - crystal X-ray analysis to be the tricyclohexane 9 , with trans,anti stereochemistry about the tricyclohexane framework. The X-ray structure of 9 is presented in Figure 1. The carbon connectivities shown in this structure firmly establish the stere- ochemistry of the precursor cyclopropene as that shown for 3 in Scheme I. Indeed , the transition state leading to 3 would appear to be lower in energy than the one leading to the remaining diastereomer of 3.13	0

hydrogens located on the neighboring methylene group indicated that the actual coupling constants must be J I = 7.4 and J2 = 10.1 Hz , respectively. These observations imply that the phenyl sub- stituent must also occupy an equatorial position in what is clearly a rather distorted pyran ring. The stereochemistry of the major diastereomer of 11 may therefore be assigned as cis , suggesting that the cycloaddition reaction prefers an endo topological course. Cycloadducts of the type 11 are recognized as latent forms of 1,s-dicarbonyl compounds , and as such they undergo clean con- version into pyridines upon exposure to hydroxylamine hydro- chloride in refluxing acetonitrile. Compound 11 was no exception , affording pyridine 12 smoothly and in good yield. Subsequent ozonolysis of the benzylidene group provided 13 in 65 % overall yield from 10. It is noteworthy that in the foregoing sequence a vinyl ether is utilized as the synthetic equivalent of the enolate of acetaldehyde.

'H NMR spectra of 11A and 11D were recorded in both CDCI , and pyr- idine - d , ; the data are presented in Tables I and 11. All assign- ments were verified by examining scalar couplings derived from phase - sensitive COSY experiments22*26 ( data not presented ) and dipole - dipole interactions. Because previous NMR analyses of natural product derived bilipeptides were performed in pyridine-d5,2 the data in Table 11 were most relevant. Having relatively large amounts of synthetic material in hand resulted in spectra of high signal - to - noise ratios , and allowed resolution enhancement by use of a squared sine bell apodization. In this way , very precise assignments of all coupling constants could be made. Salient among these were the 3-H / 5-H allylic coupling constants ( 1.2 - 1.5 Hz ) , the 2-H / 3-H coupling constants ( 5.3 Hz ) proving a trans- dihydro relative stereochemistry for both diastereomers , , and the 3-H / 3'-H coupling constants ( 3.5 - 3.9 Hz ). In CDCI , , the latter value was 5.1 Hz for 11A and 3.4 Hz for 11D. These 3-H / 3'-H coupling constants had never been determined for the natural products2 and were of value , as will be described shortly , in as- signing the conformation around the C-3 / C-3' bond and the relative stereochemistry at C-3' .	0
Cyclization of substrates 4e and 4f in Table I1 are interesting in that both the haloacetoxy and carbonyl moieties are present as side chains on 5- and 6-membered rings , respectively. It should be noted that the two side chains bear a trans relationship on the ring as a result of the manner in which they were prepared. Incorporation of a ring limits the number of degrees of freedom available to these substrates. Observed diastereoselectivities in the cyclization reactions are excellent in both cases. The stere- ochemistry of 5f was determined by single - crystal X-ray dif- fractometry , and the major diastereomer from cyclization of 4e was assumed to possess the same relative stereochemistry .	0

Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Fluorescence emission and exci- tation spectra were obtained in argon - degassed phosphate buffer , over a pH range from 5.87 to 8.77 , and are presented in Figures 6 and 7 , respectively. The excitation and absorption spectra show reasonable overlap , both giving evidence for a small red shift at higher pH ( cf. Figures 7 and 8 ). Fluorescence quantum efficiencies ( 41 ) were determined with 355-nm excitation and with quinine sulfate as a reference : values ( X 10-4 ) were 3.7,9.3 , and 14 for pH 5.5 , 7.0 , and 8.5 , respectively. These quantum efficiencies are too low , and the singlet lifetimes too short , to permit accurate measurement on our singlet lifetime fluorimeter. The fluorescence of a pH 6.5 solution bubbled with oxygen was comparable in intensity to that of an argon- deoxygenated solution .	0

In addition , although ozonides are more robust than is commonly perceived , they are known to be sensitive to solvolysis condition^.^ Nevertheless , we have found that these potential problems can be overcome through suitable design of the substrate , and we report here the first cationic ring expansion of a 1,2,4-trioxolane to a 1,2,4-trioxane. We selected ozonides of substituted cyclopentenes for study , since these form efficiently , but mainly because the relatively rigid 6,7,8-trioxabicyclo[3.2. lloctane framework offers some stereoe- lectronic control for the proposed rearrangement. Thus. migration of the ozonide substituent will not interfere , since this would lead to a bridgehead carbocation. In addition , placement of the leaving group in the exo orientation , as in 2x , sets up the possibility for neighboring - group assistance by the antiperiplanar peroxide system , a favorable circumstance for the proposed rearrangement. Finally , to further promote peroxide migration , the bridgehead (trimethylsily1)methyl group has been incorporated , both to sta- bilize the rearranged cation and to provide for self - quenching by desilylation.6	0
at X = 520 nm. Presumably the concentration of unbridged isomers of 1 can be increased by photochemical or thermal dis- sociation of M o - 0 bridge bonds , and indeed , solutions of 1 in acetone or CH3CN that have been subjected to light from an intense white light source or heated to reflux also yield large quantities of isomer 2. Acetonitrile solutions of 1 stored in the dark give only trace quantities of 2 upon workup. These findings point to a subtle difference in energies between two isomeric forms of M O ~ ( O ~ C C F ~ ) ~ ( ~ ~ ~ ) , with preference for the neutral complex occurring in less polar solvents and under conditions that increase the likelihood of forming unbridged isomers. The high-temper- ature isomerization of 1 to 2 suggests that the unsupported structure is actually more thermodynamically stable than the cis-trifluoroacetate - bridged structure. Although this conclusion may appear to be counterintuitive , it is not unreasonable if one compares the bonding interactions in the two structures. Molecule 2 possesses a much shorter Mo-Mo bond and stronger Mo-0 interactions than 1. Additional work on this intriguing system is in progress .	0

In this report we describe an experimental method that probes the thermodynamic preference for one phospholipid unit to become a covalently attached nearest neighbor of another in the bilayer state.

If the packing forces that govern NNR are the same as those that govern domain formation , then a systematic analysis of NNR should provide molecular - level insight into how the structure and composition of phospholipids influence their tendency to segregate within the lamellar phase.

This remarkable selective reactivity and difference in product stability is not unique to 7 and 10. Iodide 13a reacted rapidly with 2 to produce the air - stable stibine 13b ( 65 % ).

Department of Chemistry , University of Virginia Charlottesville , Virginia 22901 Received July 5 , 1991 Although coordination of a nitrile to a transition metal through the nitrogen lone pair has been well established,l the ability of these ligands to donate through one of their *-orbitals has been demonstrated only recently.28* Of the few v2 - nitrile complexes which have been structurally characterized , most can be regarded as electronically saturated complexes by considering the nitrile as a two - electron donor. Presently , we report the preparation and characterization of the 16e- complex [ W(bpy)(PMe3)2Cl(q2- NCCH3)]+ , along with structural and spectroscopic evidence for the nitrile ligand acting as a four - electron donor .	0
When more sterically unhindered 9-ethyladenine ( 6 ) is used as a guest molecule , the behavior of complex formation is very similar to that of 5A , Le. , titration patterns for 1Zn and other porphyrins are again biphasic and monophasic , respectively , though the observed association constants are 2-8 times larger than those for 5A , and 6 is also bound by the metal - free porphyrin , 1H2 , but not by 3H2 ( Table I ). These observations suggest that two adenine molecules are bound by 1Zn at two independent recognition sites , for example , as shown in Figure 1 b. ’ The existence of the hydrogen bonds between 1Zn and 6 is confirmed by ‘ H NMR experiments , which show a significant downfield shift of the signal of OH protons of 1Zn together with upfield shifts of those of adenine protons.* Since these hydrogen bondings are observed even at the low concentration of 6 where the 1 : l complex is dominant , the first binding step is tentatively assigned to that for the hydrogen - bonding site.9 Finally , it should be noted that the association constant ( K , ) for this first binding step of 6 is one of	0

B3LYP calculations on the model complex (PH3)2H2Ru(SiH4)- RuH2(PH3)2 ( 2 ). 15 A geometry optimization followed by a vibrational frequency analysis results in a D2d geometry with no imaginary frequencies. Optimized geometrical parameters and X-ray data for 2b are compared in Table 1. Our calculation confirms the overall structure found by X-ray diffraction. As expected , X-ray Ru-H distances are found shorter than the calculated ones. However , the calculated Ru-Si distance ( 2.229 Å ) is in good agreement with the experimental one. The comparison with optimized Ru-Si bond lengths in Ł2 - silane complexes ( 2.425 Å in [RuH2{(Ł2-H-SiH2)2(C6H4)}(PH3)2] (A),8b 2.394 Å in RuH2(Ł2-H2)(Ł2-H-SiH3)(PH3)2 (B))9 reveals an unusual short distance in 2 , suggesting some double bond ( 14 ) JH - Siobs ) 1 / 8 ( 4 1JH-Si + 4 2JH-Si ) ) 36 Hz. Assuming a 2JH-Si value in the range 0-20 Hz for the coupling between the silicon and the classical hydrides H1 , H2 , H1¢ , and H2¢ , one can estimate a JH-Si value of 52 to 72 Hz for the coupling between the silicon and the hydrides H3 , H4 , H3¢ , and H4¢ .

For these atoms and for the hydrogen atoms directly attached to Si and Ru , double-œ plus polarization basis sets were used.

In the biosynthesis of vitamin B6 in Escherichia coli,1,2 pyridoxol 5¢ -phosphate ( 4 ) is derived from two acyclic building blocks , 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate ( dXP , 3 ) and 4-hydroxy- L-threonine 4-phosphate ( HTP , 1 ) ( Scheme 1 ). We have shown that the first step in this process involves the oxidative decar- boxylation of HTP by the NAD+ - dependent enzyme 4-hydroxy- threonine 4-phosphate dehydrogenase (PdxA)3 to give an unstable intermediate tentatively identified as 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone 3-phosphate ( 2 ). 4 More recently , it was found that pyridoxol phosphate synthase (PdxJ)5 catalyzes the condensation of 2 with dXP ( 3 ) to give pyridoxol phosphate and 1 equiv of inorganic phosphate.6,7 The reaction has a Km(app) for dXP of 26.9 ( cid : 237)M and a kcat of 4.2 min-1. The free alcohol , 1-deoxy-D-xylulose , is not a substrate. Formation of 4 has been postulated to involve initial formation of a Schiff ’s base between 2 and 3 , followed by a sequence of steps in which the key cyclization reaction is the result of nucleophilic attack of a transiently generated enol on the carbonyl carbon derived from the ketone moiety of 2. Various mechanistic proposals differ in the precise timing and mechanism suggested for the loss of the phosphate group of dXP.6,7 The results here reported provide further evidence for the mode of action of PdxA and of PdxJ , and provide insight into the mechanism of formation of pyridoxol 5¢ -phosphate ( 4 ) , based on the origin of its oxygen atoms .	0
Treatment of the three DHFR analogues containing allylglycine with I2 afforded cleavage products having the expected sizes ( illustrated in Figure 3 for Asp27 AGly ). 12 The cleavage site was established both by gel and capillary electrophoresis.13 The cleavage products could be separated readily from unreacted protein by Ni - NTA chromatography ( Figure 3B ). While I2 - induced cleavage efficiency was expected to vary from site to site based on solvent accessibility of the allyl group , protein secondary structure at the allylglycine site seems to be a more important determinant of cleavage efficiency ( Table 1 ). Presumably , the ease of formation of the cyclic intermediate ( Figure 1 ) is critical to the success of the overall cleavage reaction and certain peptide conformations ( e.g. R-helix ) are more conducive to the requisite cyclization.14	0
Abstract : Etching of the dimer reconstructed silicon surface with an initial coverage of a monolayer of fluorine by 3.0-eV fluorine atoms at normal incidence has been examined with molecular dynamics. In the simulation , fluorine adsorption and product etching occur at the top of two atomic layers of silicon , which are exposed to the vacuum. We have identified mechanisms responsible for the gas - phase products SiF4 and Si2F , , where x = 5 and 6. In addition , we have simulated a near-steady-state etched surface where the majority of the adspecies are monofluorinated species with a significant amount of difluorinated and trifluorinated species. Observed fluorosilyl towerlike structures are found to be important to the etching of the Si2F , species , and they also provide insight as to the possible structure of the adlayer formed on silicon samples after long time exposure to XeF2 .	0

Abstract : The synthesis of trans-perchlorovinylenebis(a,a,cY',a'-tetraphenyl- 1,3-xylylene ) ( l ) , an exceptionally stable organic carbon tetraradical , which is isolated as a deep red solid , stable in air up to 200 O C , is reported. The electronic spectrum of 1 is presented and commented on. The cyclic voltammogram of 1 , exhibiting two consecutive redox couples with standard potentials of -0.175 and -0.480 V vs SCE , is discussed in view of the exhaustive controlled - potential electrolysis of the tetraradical into the corresponding tetraanion. Magnetic susceptibility measurements from 4.2 to 300 K show that a pair of triplets is the ground state of the tetraradical , being W = 240 f 10 cm-I ( 0.69 kcal / mol ) , the tripletsinglet energy gap. At low temperatures , a weak antiferromagnetic interaction was observed ( negative and low value of Weiss constant 8 = -1.1 i 0.1 K ). From an EPR analysis in frozen 2-methyltetrahydrofuran over the range 4-1 29 K , the presence of two diastereoisomeric forms of the molecule is tentatively suggested. Accordingly , from the two symmetric and outer pairs of peaks of Ams = f 1 transition in the spectrum , two different ID / hcl values , 0.010 and 0.013 cm-I , are calculated that are in good agreement with those reported for perchloro-m-xylylene. Supporting the presence of the two forms of 1 , the Am , = f 2 transition exhibits two overlapping lines. The intensity of this transition rises continuously from 129 to 4 K , also supporting that the ground state is a pair of triplets .	0
Raman Scattering of Alkanethiol Monolayers at Au formational information about the C-C Obtaining in- formation directly about the u(C-C) bands is difficult , because these bands are weak in the IR spectra and are not present in surface spectra.' Raman spectroscopy provides valuable infor- mation about other important vibrational features of alkanethiols , such as the C-S bond and the carbon backbone , in addition to information in the u(C-H) region. This report discusses the use of Raman scattering in the u(C-S) , v(C-C) , u(S-H) , and u(C-H) regions to characterize a series of 1-alkanethiol films at Au. Of particular interest in this work was the utility of Raman scattering for providing direct information on the number and location of gauche conformations in these films .	0
Abstract : Cu is an intracrystalline promoter for methanol synthesis catalyzed by ZnO. High - affinity CO bonding to Cu / ZnO has been shown ( Didziulis , S. V. ; Butcher , K. D. ; Cohen , S. L. ; Solomon , E. I. J. Am. Chem. SOC. 1989 , 222,7110 ) to involve a coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Cu(1) site which is also present on the CuCI( 1 1 1 ) model surface. CO is found to bind to the CuCI( 1 1 1 ) surface nondissociatively with its molecular axis normal to the surface and with a high heat of adsorption of 23 * 2 kcal / mol , similar to that of CO on Cu / ZnO. Variable photon energy photoelectron spectroscopy ( PES ) has been used to investigate the nature of this bonding and to compare this to CO bonding to the coordinatively unsaturated Zn(I1) site on ZnO(lOT0 ). CO binding to CuCl is found to induce a shift of Cu 3d , levels to deeper binding energy and to result in the presence of intense CO core level satellites , both results indicating the presence of A back - bonding of intermediate strength , which is not found to be present for CO bonding to ZnO. Differences in the u bonding interaction are indicated by the 2.2 vs 1.3 eV shift of the CO 5u peak to deeper binding energy upon adsorption on CuCl vs ZnO. This however is complicated by the CO 5u interaction with the fully occupied Cu 3d band , which is found to be present from the 5u photoemission cross section and shifts the 5u peak energy but does not contribute to the net bonding interaction. A more direct probe of u bonding	0
As far as we are aware , this is the first example of a compound that illustrates clear IR coalescence which can be predicted on the basis of a very simple model. The complicated v(C0) spectrum of 42 % I3CO - enriched Fe(C0)3(04-norbornadiene) in LKr / Xe at low temperatures can be accurately fitted with the four pa- rameters considered in the energy - factored CO force field ap- propriate for the M(CO)3 group under C , symmetry. Warming the molecule to high temperature in scXe produces dramatic spectral changes including band broadening and coalescence. The appearance of the high - temperature " rapid exchange " spectrum can be predicted using the two parameters appropriate for the M(CO)3 group under (pseudo)-C , , symmetry , which are obtained by statistically averaging the above four parameters .	0
As pointed out b e f ~ r e , ~ J a dramatic change of photochemical quantum yields within a short range of wavelengths can not be explained by ground - state conformational arguments. On the basis of the fact that hexatriene has two close - lying excited states , a two - state model was suggested.8 In this section , we will analyze the spectroscopic data to derive estimates for the 0-0 excitation energies for these two states in pre D3 and then show how the wavelength dependence of the photochemical quantum yields , the wavelength dependence of the fluorescence quantum yield , and the temperature dependence of fluorescence intensity may be coherently understood within the two - state model .	0
although delocalization occurs , the resonance energy provided thereby is small.1 ° Will this be true also for loss of an electron from an amidinide ion to give a radical with nitrogen atoms at the termini of the allylic system ? Or will the smaller electro- negativity of nitrogen than oxygen and the equivalence of the radical contributors ( Scheme I ) provide a measurable resonance energy ? We will try to answer these questions in the sections that follow. Results and Discussion	0
For the middle and later first row transition metals , chromium to copper , the number and variety of high - valent and / or strongly oxidizing complexes are limited by the small range of compatible ligands. Two properties of ligand complements are especially important in determining the compatibility : ( i ) the donor capacity , since strong donor ligands reduce the oxidizing properties of high - valent complexes and ( ii ) the ability of the ligand complement to resist oxidative destruction , since strongly oxidizing metal centers tend to rapidly degrade oxidatively sensitive ligands. Significant advantages can ensue from the development of ligand complements which have a high donor capacity combined with superior resistance to oxidative destruction. Such ligands have allowed for the isolation and study of analogues of more reactive and elusive putative intermediates in catalytic homogeneous ox- idations.2 Long - lived homogeneous catalysts3 have been developed with ligand complements that are resistant to oxidation but not strongly donating. In this report , we present the synthesis of a series of tetraamide macrocycles ( H4[ 11-H4[3] ) which have been designed to afford strongly donating tetraamido-N ligands upon tetradeprotonation and to be resistant to oxidative destruction. It is demonstrated by the isolation and characterization of an unprecedented class	0
A feature of the data in Tables I and 111 is the lack of a strict correlation between the B-P bond lengths and the rotation barriers , or even the pyramidicity , at phosphorus. The main reason for this is that X-ray structural data concerns the ground state only , whereas the rotation process involves both ground and transition states. Thus , 9 and 10 , which have shorter B-P bonds than that in 8 , have lower rotation barriers probably because of different excited - state structures. A further example of a lack of correlation concerns the different B-P distances found in the two Mes,BP- (t-Bu)z molecules of 3 where the longer B-P distance is associated with the flatter P center .	0
Addition of Carbon Dioxide to 1. The direct reduction of carbon dioxide occurs at potentials more negative than -2.2 V , in agreement with literature data.20a The solubility of C 0 2 in DMF at 25 OC was estimated to be about 2 X 10-1 M. Bubbling C 0 2 into a solution of 1 results in the modified cyclic voltammograms , as illustrated in Figure I , curve c. The first two - electron reducing wave remains at -1.2 V and becomes less reversible , whereas a catalytic wave appears at -1.6 V. Earlier work has shown that the catalytic process observed is characteristic of the reduction of coordinated COz to its radical anionI6*l7 ( Scheme 111 ) .	0
As described above , the cyclic voltammetric investigations were carried out on glassy carbon disk electrodes. Preliminary ex- periments carried out with a carbon crucible as working electrode showed that this material is not suitable for preparative scale electrolyses in the sense that the electrode is rapidly passivated. Satisfactory results were obtained with a mercury pool electrode stirred with a magnetic stirrer. For this reason we examined , through a series of test experiments , whether or not the cyclic voltammetric results are affected by the change of the working electrode from a glassy carbon disk to a mercury drop hung onto a gold disk. In the absence of porphyrins the current rise due to the direct reduction of C 0 2 under 1 atm shifts negatively by about	0
Compared to the numerous methylene-bridged complexes , there are far fewer exanpies of compounds containing a -CH2CH2- bridge between two metals. Two-carbon bridges present the additional possibility of linking the two metals by Cz bridges having different C-C bond orders.

In contrast , substitution of chloride with acetate produces a decrease in rate by a factor of 21 at 50 OC.

Capture of simple molecular gases undergoing high - energy collisions with fullerene ions could not be documented previously.6 For example , collisions of C60*+ with D2 gave rise to no D- or D2 - containing products.6 We were able , however , to detect both CaD+ and CaD2*+ ( see Figure 4 ). The inability to detect lower mass product ions containing D or D2 in the experiments reported here and elsewhere6 may be due to rupture of the D-D bond with subsequent loss of the deuteriums .	0
The results given here will be elaborated in a comprehensive report of the products and energetics of high - energy collisions of C60*+ , C70*+ , and other fullerene radical cations with a number of target gases.I0 Other issues addressed include the kinetic energy of product ions that contain the target gas , the variation of the spectra of product ions as a function of both energy and number of collisions , and the end points in the capture processes. Com- parison of the predicted kinetic energies of product ions with the observed values convinces us that the majority of the fullerene product ions produced from high - energy collisions with small target gases result from fragmentation of the intermediate fullerene endohedral complex.I0	0

The transfer of Br+ between the two ethylenes requires a transition through the Du structure (IV),I7 the energy of which was calculated to be 13.47 kcal mol-' above the energy of III ( 9.20 kcal mol- ! above the energy of the isolated systems , U ) , reflecting sizable distortion of the molecular structure. The geometric parameters that vary most in the transfer are given in Table 11. From the experimental activation parameters , the second - order rate constant for the degenerate transfer of Br+ from I to Ad = Ad at 25 OC is calculated to be -2 X IO7 M-' s-I. While it may be argued that I is atypical in that it can not form normal addition products , we see no reason why a less encumbered bromonium ion would not be prone to transfer at comparable or even greater rates. These results indicate that intermolecular Br+ transfer from ion to olefin must be considered as competitive with the various product - forming steps during the electrophilic bromination of olefins .	0

The synthesis and initial binding studies that are reported here illustrate that stereoselective binding can be achieved in water by a synthetic receptor without multiple receptor - substrate hy- drogen bonds. The results are modest , but in these initial studies , partially water soluble guests were tested , and they were chosen because they were easily available and the association constants could be accurately measured. Less water soluble targets will have higher affinities for this receptor , and other guests will be bound more enantioselectively. Because the synthesis is convergent and capping structures more elaborate and interactive than 4,4'- methylenebis(ani1ine) can easily be utilized , other , more shape- selective synthetic receptors can be based on this general system.

The initial inhibition experiments with diethyl 1-hexynyl phosphate and the phosphotriesterase were conducted at a constant enzyme concentration of 50 pM. Incubation of the inhibitor ( 1-1000 pM ) and enzyme for 2 min at pH 7 resulted in > 99 % loss of all enzyme activity. Dialysis of the inhibited enzyme solution against 100 mM PIPES , pH 7.0 , for up to 72 h gave no detectable increase in enzyme ac ! ivky. 111 a control experiment , uninhibited enzyme , dialyzed against 100 mM PIPES , pH 7.0 , for 72 h lost only 5 % of the original activity. The failure of extensive dialysis to reactivate the enzyme is consistent with the formation of a covalent bond between enzyme and inhibitor. Incubation of the inhibited enzyme with 50-100 mM hydroxyl- amine , at pH 7.0 , for up to 24 h also failed to regenerate any enzyme activity .	0
rate constant for inactivation , kin is the maximal rate of inactivation at saturating inhibitor , [I] is the initial inhibitor concentration , Ki is the Michaelis constant for [I] , A is the paraoxon concen- tration , and K , is the Michaelis constant for A. The maximal rate of inactivation at saturating inhibitor is 0.33 f 0.01 s-I and Ki = 58 f 4 pM ( A = 0.25 mM and Ka = 42 pM ). Using the minimal model for mechanism - based inhibition which appears in Scheme 11 , the rate expression for the inactivation rate is kh = ( k3k7 ) / ( k3 + k5 + k7 ). Since k5 > > k7 , the minimum value of the rate constant ( k7 ) for the reaction of the putative ketene intermediate with the protein is 0.33 s-I. The minimum value of the rate constant for P-O bond cleavage and product release ( k , and k , ) is 410 s-l. This value compares very favorably with the k , , for paraoxon of 2100 s-l , and thus the alkynyl phosphate esters are quite respectable substrates for the bacterial phosphotriesterase. Although irreversible inhibition of many enzymes by alkynes and alkenes has been previously r e p ~ r t e d , ~ diethyl I -hexynyl phosphate is the first alkynyl phosphate ester to irreversibly in- activate an enzyme. This compound is the first mechanism - based inhibitor reported for the bacterial phosphotriesterase. The alkynyl phosphate esters may prove to be useful for the active - site labeling	0

Abstract : We report on the synthesis and characterization of Zr - phosphate / phosphonate ( ZP ) self - assembled multilayer structures using surface second harmonic generation measurements. We use two structurally complementary ł(2) - active chromophores that can be deposited with orientational control relative to the substrate. These chromophores produce multilayer ł(2) responses identical in magnitude but of opposite sign. We form opposing bilayers with these chromophores to produce two different structural motifs , each with a local center of inversion about the ZP interlayer bonding plane. The ł(2) responses of these two bilayer systems are different and reveal the extent to which the dipole approximation is valid in these layered assemblies. Our data elucidate the role that quadrupolar terms play in the ł(2) responses of thin interfacial films. This work illustrates the complex and subtle structural issues associated with the design and construction of layered interfaces and provides a means to evaluate the vacancy and orientational defect density in layered materials .	0

On the basis of these exploratory studies and our experience in the crambescidin / ptilomycalin A series , a convergent plan for preparing 13,14,15-isocrambescidin 800 ( 1 ) readily emerged ( Scheme 1 ). Tethered Biginelli condensation of guanidine aldehyde 10 and ( cid : 226 ) - ketoester 11 would be employed to set the critical trans C10 - C13 stereorelationship and unite all the heavy atoms of the pentacyclic guanidine moiety. It was hoped that acid - promoted dehydration of 9 would then generate the remaining three heterocyclic rings of 8 in a single step. We were mindful from the outset of one challenge posed by this strategy : the guanidine functional group would be introduced early in the synthesis. Unless we wanted to add protection and	0
An understanding of the stereoelectronic effects operating in oxygen transfer would contribute greatly to the understanding of the role of the fluoro group ( and other electronegative heteroa- toms , or groups , Z ) in these systems , and aid in the design of improved catalysts.

The results obtained from the reactions of several cyclobutene- diones ( 1a-d ) with 2-norbornene ( 2a ) under optimum conditions are listed in Table 1. In all cases , the starting cyclobutenediones were completely consumed , and the products detected by GLC were only the corresponding cyclopentenones , 3a-d. As for 1d , the carbon monoxide pressure had to be increased to 15 atm because of the high reactivity of 1d toward complete decarbo- nylation. On the other hand , 3,4-dialkylcyclobutenedione , such as 3,4-dibutylcyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dione ( 1e ) , gave the correspond- ing hydroquinone 4a instead of the cyclopentenone , probably via a (maleoyl)ruthenium intermediate ( eq 1 ). 11b Accordingly , the ring- opening of cyclobutenediones by ruthenium catalysts depends on the substituents of the cyclobutenediones. The reaction of ethylene ( 2b ) with 1a in 1,4-dioxane also gave the corresponding cyclo- pentenone 3e in 65 % yield ( eq 2 ) .	0

The diiron active site of M M O catalyzes the initial oxidation step in the conversion of methane to C 0 2 in which one atom of dioxygen is incorporated into the C-H bond of methane to yield methanol.IOJ While structurally similar to the dinuclear iron-oxo centers of hemerythrin ( HR),I2 ribonucleotide reductase (RR),I3 and the purple acid phosphatases (PAP),I4 this unique site not only catalyzes the conversion of methane to methanol but also the incorporation of an oxygen atom of O2 into alkanes , alkenes , ethers , and alicyclic , aromatic , and heterocyclic com- pounds.I0.li	0

Abstract : The design , synthesis , and study of a molecular template , 1 la , that catalyzes its own formation from simpler components , 9 and lOd , is described. Autocatalysis is shown by the following : ( 1 ) the increase in rate of reaction of 9 and 1Od in the presence of Ila ; ( 2 ) the reduction in rate of reaction in the presence of 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine inhibitor ; and ( 3 ) the reduction in rate of reaction when a component incapable of template behavior , 10h , is substituted for 1Od. Three kinetic pathways are elucidated : ( I ) the background bimolecular reaction ( eq 6 ) ; ( 2 ) the preassociative mechanism ( eq 7 ) ; and ( 3 ) the template termolecular process ( eq 8 ). A kinetic model for the replication process is introduced , and equilibrium and rate constants are determined. Predictions for the shapes of the product growth curves are made .	0

In addition , comparisons of the SET - sensitized ( path a in Scheme I ) and direct - irradiation ( path b in Scheme I ) induced photoprocesses Of these systems demonstrated how the former method is superior in promoting photocyclization reactions in cases where the cu , @ -unsaturated ester and ketone excited states are too reactive to be quenched by intramolecular SET from the tethered amine donors or where diradicals produced as intermediates in the direct - irradiation processes undergo alternative fragmentation reactions rather than cyclization. These investigations also showed that problems encountered with the use of the SET-photosensi- tization methodology and associated with the ready oxidation of slowly cyclizing a-amino radical intermediates can be avoided by the proper selection of photosensitizer and substituents on the amine functions.

Previously , Sigel et al. reported a similar relationship between the phosphomonoester dianion affinity with ZnlIaq ion and phosphate ligand basicity.22 In addition , the present results in phosphate anion complexation using our model have first disclosed that Zn " acidity is also a significant factor determining the binding stability between Zn " and phosphate anion.

The lack of irreversible inhibition is inconsistent with a mechanism involving a covalent enzymeintermediate adduct such as 4. While the observation that both 6-fluoro-EPSPs are potent competitive inhibitors does not itself support or preclude any of the other mechanisms in Scheme I , it does provide a useful tool for future mechanistic studies of the enzyme.

With 9a , the simultaneous association of the zirconium metal with the alkene6 ( to form the zirconacyclopropane ) and the neighboring heteroatom ’ may culminate in the significant en- hancement of reaction efficiency. Since C-C bond formation occurs from the exo face , it follows that the alkyl adduct may arise from an anti mode of addition ( anti to the Zr - alkene complex ). * In a nucleophilic attack on a metal - alkene system , based on the mechanistic postulates of H ~ f f m a n n , ~ the reactiue metal - olefin complex is one where the metal has shifted toward a terminus of the double bond. It is tenable that , in reactions of 9a and 9b , the heteroatom binds ( with varying degrees of efficiency ) to the transition metal and directs its slippage toward C6 , so t h a t al- kylation occurs regioselectively at the more distal carbon , C5. This mechanism scheme , as well as whether such a mode of addition pertains to reactions of acyclic substrates , is under investigation.I0 In summary , in zirconium - catalyzed ethylmagnesations , co- ordination of a heteroatom with t h e transition metal is required for obtention of high stereoselectivity. Such association improves the efficiency of the carbometalation to a large extent ; in the absence of a resident Lewis base , there may be little or no reaction.

As consistent with the structure , the FD-MS spectrum of 3 exhibits a peak at 1086 due to the molecular ion. Another notable feature of 3 is that it gives rise to a reasonably sharp and isotropically shifted 'H NMR spectrum. The low magnetic susceptibility ( 2.88 pB / mol at 296 K ) also suggests the strongly antiferromagnetic property of 3 .	0
The visible absorption spectrum of complex 1 contains a strong band at 436 nm ( t ca. 8000 cm-l L M-I ) as well as generally stronger absorption throughout the visible region compared to Cm alone. Changes in color of solutions of 1 provide a convenient way to monitor its susceptibility to reactions , especially those leading to displacement of c60 ( see Scheme I ). Thus , exposure of a solution of the complex to an excess of CO , P(OMe)3 , or PPh3 leads to a rapid ( ca. 1 min ) change in color from green to the characteristic mauve of c60 ; the known derivatives (s5-C,H7)Ir- (CO)(L) , which are pale yellow to colorless compounds , can be observed by their IR ( vco ) bands. ” Figure 1 shows the spectral changes for a saturated solution of CO in dichloromethane at room	0
( I ) There is a large kinetic 0-deuterium isotope effect on the elimination reaction of 3-FArC(CLj)20PFB of ( k6,. , / k6D)elim = 4.3 ( Table 1 ). For an ion pair mechanism , deprotonation competes with the rapid diffusional separation of the ion pair ( kd = 1OIo s - ' ) ~ and / or capture of the ion pair by solvent ( k l = IO " s-I for 3-FArC(Me)2+),2 so that the barrier to proton transfer must also be very small. It is difficult to reconcile the large isotope effect with an extremely rapid proton transfer reaction in which little discrimination between abstraction of a proton and of a deuteron is expected .	0

The reaction of hydrazoic acid with ketones to afford a ring- expanded lactam ( the Schmidt reaction ) is an important method for the preparation of nitrogen - containing heterocycles.' The extension of the reaction to provide N - substituted lactams would be particularly useful ; , however , attempts to replace hydrazoic acid with alkyl azides under classical Schmidt conditions ( strong acid ) were generally unsucce ~ sful.l ~ ~ In a series of papers in the late 195Os , Boyer and co-workers did manage to establish a narrow range of azides that react with aromatic aldehydes , but the bona fide migration of an alkyl group was not observed in any of these example^.^,^ In addition , the intramolecular reaction of several enones with azides gave Schmidt - type products upon thermolysis , but the reaction proceeds by initial attack of the azide upon the double bond followed by rearrangement of the resulting triazoline.6 An intramolecular Schmidt reaction of the type shown in eq 1 would constitute an attractive entry into ring systems sporting a nitrogen atom at one of the ring fusion positions.

In light of the widespread occurrence of the hydroindole unit as a substructure in numerous alkaloid families , this methodology , which can accommodate substantial structural modifications , should prove of considerable utility for the rapid assembly of a range of target natural products. As a particularly stringent test of the scope of this process for carbon-carbon bond formation in the face of significant steric hindrance and as a model for the construction of the Sceletium alkaloids ( mesembrine ) , the iso- cyanate derived from carboxylic acid 66 was exposed to cyclohexyl isocyanide ( CyNC ) under normal conditions. While no cyclo- addition was detected at room temperature , the cyclization pro- ceeded smoothly in refluxing xylene to give adduct f ( mp 186-1 88 " C ) in 51 % overall yield. The functionalization available in intermediate 7 is particularly significant with regard to the eventual construction of certain Amaryllidaceae alkaloids such as tazettine.

The lifetime of triplet benzaldehyde in t-BuPh was too short to obtain am , and solutions of formaldehyde in organic solvents are too unstable to make reliable measurements.6	0
We reported previously* that reaction 6 gave the lowest yields of excited states in t-BuPh when the carbonyl product was form- aldehyde , benzaldehyde , or benzophenone. The triplet energies of these three compounds are 72 kcal or less. " Since a higher triplet state of DBA , located at 74.6 kcal , mediates the overall TS energy transfer,5 eq 4a , it is not surprising that would be low for the two aldehydes and negligibly small in the case of benzophenone. In addition , t-BuPh was found to quench triplet benzaldehyde , whereas acetonitrile , used here , does not .	0

The sin let and triplet states of methylene are not in rapid equilibrium in solution ; Ii their energy separation is too large. " ( 9 ) Scheme I is a conventional ' interpretation of singlet - triplet phenomena in carbene chemistry. However , it has been pointed out ( Griller , D. ; Nazran , A. S. ; Scaiano , J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984 , 106 , 198 ) that the available data for aryl carbenes is consistent with the presence of a single reactive inter- mediate , one that can undergo reactions normally ascribed to either the triplet or the singlet state of the carbene. In this interpretation a triplet carbene can react with pyridine to form an ylide via a singlet - triplet surface crossing along the reaction coordinate. The surface crossing mechanism resolves inconsis- tencies in the kinetics of reaction of triplet diphenylcarbene and methanol. The data of this work is consistent with either a preequilibrium or surface crossing mechanism. The traditional mechanism is presented in Scheme I because there is no compelling reason to discard it with dimethylcarbene. ( IO ) Turro , N. J. ; Cha , Y. ; Could , 1. R. J . Am. Chem.

Institut fur Anorganische Chemie Universitat Regensburg , Universitatsstrasse 31 0-8400 Regensburg , Federal Republic of Germany Received May 28 , I991 . Revised Manuscript Received September 17 , I991 Metal - centered ( MC ) excited states play an important role in the photophysics and photochemistry of coordination compounds.' However , the study of MC states has been essentially limited to d and f block elements , while the main group metals were largely ignored.2 This lack of knowledge is quite surprising since MC excited states of many main group metal complexes can be easily studied by emission spectroscopy under ambient conditions. Although simple halide complexes of s2 metals such as TI+ , SnZ+ , Pbz+ , and Sb3+ are known to be luminescent in solution,2 this observation has been occasionally used only for analytical ap- plications but hardly for the characterization of the emitting excited state. On the contrary , the emission of s2 ions which are doped into host lattices has been studied in detail by solid - state physicist^.^^^ We report here our observations on the photolu- minescence of SbC14- , SbCI , " , BiCI4- , and BiC1,3- in solution and discuss the nature of the emitting excited state. While an emission of SbCls3- in CHC1 , has been reported before,sy6 the other three complex ions are not yet known to show photoluminescence in solution at room temperature .	0
Recently , the preparation of dimeric molecules containing two of the DNA - alkylating cyclopropa[c]pyrrolo[3,2-e]indol-4- (5H)-one ( CPI ) subunits of CC - 1065 was reported by these laboratories.'

The contrasts between linear and helical bisquinones are striking. Unlike I*- , 7a'- and 7b'- exhibit no well - defined ab- sorption in the near - IR. & For 7a the difference between the first and second reduction potentials ( 120 mV ) is one - quarter that of 1.2c For 7b*- the ESR spectrum changes with temperature , demonstrating that an electron localized on one quinone hops to the other with rate constant k = 6 X IO8 s-I at room temperature. " That the anion radicals of all the helical quinones , not just that of 1 , have delocalized structures ( unlike the linear analogues , for which this is true for only the two lowest memberskd ) is suggested by AE in Table I decreasing monotonically but still being ap- preciable when the quinones are separated by six rings.2w We speculate that the differences between the helical and linear anions may originate in the ends of the helices interacting. Perhaps this constitutes a new form of cyclic delocalization.Is	0
rearranged products were observed. In view of the high reactivity of 3 toward free radicals , " it is possible that 5 was formed by a free radical addition process. However , it is more likely to be a cationic process for the following reasons. The reactivity of 3 toward electrophiles is extraordinarily high , and a hypoiodite should be a good electrophile. When the reaction of 2 with base was carried out in the presence of a good carbocation trap , azide ion,I4 I-azido-3-iodobicyclo[l.l .l]pentane became the major product.I5 These data strongly suggest that 4 can be an inter- mediate in the reaction and that it has a reasonable lifetime before rearranging. The increased lifetime as compared to that of the parent cation would presumably result from the iodine substituent , which would destabilize the rearranged cation.

The final product of the oxidation in both cases was thio- sulfonate 13.22 The identities of the remaining intermediates , 10 , 11 , and 12 , are deduced by a careful analysis of the possible pathways that intermediates 8 and 9 may follow in order to produce thiosulfonate 13 ( Scheme I ). It is known from the NMR spectra that 10 and 12 were unsymmetrical species and 11 was symmetric ; they were also stable enough to exist at room tem- perature and above but could not be isolated. Intermediates 10 and 12 are therefore best assigned as the two possible OS - sulfenyl sulfinates and can easily be pictured to form from a head - to - tail recombination of the two sulfinyl radicals.23 Species 11 logically is assigned as a sulfinic anhydride ; however , the disappearance of this species without evidence for a decomposition product argues that 11 is likely the symmetric endo a-disulfoxide ( Scheme I ). The formation of final product 13 can clearly be pictured to proceed via rearrangement of 0,s - sulfenyl sulfinates 10 and 12.5.1 3-1 5	0

Hydrogen peroxide , essential for eliminating the interferants , can not be externally added in in vivo assays but can be produced in situ by oxidases ; thus , lactate oxidase ( LOD ) generates hydrogen peroxide in the presence of lactate and oxygen ( eq 2 ). Using an electrode containing LOD ( 250 U a r 2 ) coimmobilized with HRP and physiological levels of lactate ( 0.5 mM ) we oxidatively stripped the interferants and accurately measured glucose levels without adding hydrogen peroxide. The results we obtained were similar to those shown in Figure 2. A control experiment performed to examine the effect of addition of lactate ( 1.5 mM ) on the elec- trocatalytic oxidation current for 5 mM glucose showed that the change in the current was less than 2 % . Since electrooxidation of glucose at the wired GOD does not involve O , , the removal of oxygen by lactate ( eq 2 ) has only a marginal effect on the glucose assay. The current does not change with lactate con- centration , because LOD is not “ wired ” to the electrode being ’ physically separated from the redox epoxy. The one purpose of LOD in this structure is to produce in situ hydrogen peroxide for the HRP - catalyzed elimination of interferants. The LOD-cata- lyzed generation of H202 is O2 dependent , and no peroxide is formed in the total absence of oxygen. In the physiological range oxygen concentrations provide , however , the excess hydrogen peroxide needed , and thus fluctuations in oxygen concentration do not affect the elimination of interferants .	0

ligand exchange reaction is performed in the presence of diphenylketene , ketene complex 2 is formed in 61 % yield. The Ł2 - ( C,C ) binding of the ketene ligand in 2 was suggested by the strong IR absorption at 1728 cm-1 and the 13C NMR shifts of the ketene carbons [ 195.50 ( dd , J ) 6.2 , 3.5 Hz , OdCdC ) and 23.6 ( d , J ) 47.5 Hz , OdCdC)].13,16,18 Furthermore , the fact that all four ortho protons appeared as a single resonance was consistent with an Ł2 - ( C,C ) complex , whereas an Ł2 - ( C,O ) isomer ( not shown ) would have inequivalent phenyl groups. We note that the same phosphine and same ketene on Ni(0) gave an Ł2- ( C,O ) complex.19 The phosphorus nuclei in 2 are inequivalent ( -8.39 and -22.39 ppm , two doublets , J ) 30.3 Hz ).

Construction of supramolecular architectures with inner cavities is a subject of current interest because of their ability for selective inclusion of ions and molecules , molecular recognition , and catalysis for specific chemical transformations.1-6 The potential use of such species largely depends on their cavity size and type , which are mainly controlled by the ligands via appropriate metal ions.2-6 A number of such species with inner cavities have been prepared and characterized.7-13 Very recently , several metallo- supramolecular capsules with enclosure - like systems and very large inner cavities were reported.

Regiochemical Aspect of Silicon - Tether Strategy.

Both AM1 calculations and ab initio SCF-MO calculations with the 6-31G** basis set'* reveal that 4 is planar , and the rotational barrier of 4 around the C-N bond is calculated to be 10.17a and 16.1 kcal / mol by the AMI and ab initio calculations , respectively. The rotational barrier is estimated to be about 20 kcal / mol ex- perimentally , " and is therefore somewhat underestimated by the AM1 calculation. Table I summarizes the optimum H-0 contact distance ( rapt ) and the interaction energy ( AE ) of 5 ( for linear N-H -- 0 Z ) calculated by employing the	0
Abstract : Resonance Raman studies are carried out for the O2 adducts of superstructured " jellyfish " cobalt - porphyrin complexes with several trans-axial ligands , namely , pyridine , 3,5-lutidine , and imidazole as well as several of their deuteriated analogues. Two superstructured , bis-strapped porphyrins , having either short ( 9 carbon atoms ) or long ( 1 2 carbon atoms ) strap lengths , are employed along with sterically relaxed ( non-strapped ) porphyrins. It is found that the short - strap derivative induces distortion of the bound ligands while the long - strap analogue permits normal , unencumbered binding. While the distortion of the trans-axial ligand does not significantly affect the C0-0 , linkage , as judged by the constancy of the inherent frequency of u ( o . O ) , significant shifts of the ligand internal modes give rise to substantially altered spectra as a result of variations in the strength of vibrational coupling of the v ( 0 - 0 ) with internal modes of the trans-axial ligand .	0
Abstract : The formation of alkylsilanes ( SiR,Hex , x 5 3 ) from the reaction of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) or 1-iodopropane with an aluminum - promoted silicon surface at 450-600 K under ultra-high-vacuum conditions is reported. With both reactants , alkylsilane production is accompanied by alkene evolution , and in the case of TIBA aluminum deposition. Isotope labeling studies show that the hydrogen atoms in the alkylsilane product come from the j3-carbon of the alkyl intermediate generated on the surface by the dissociative chemisorption of the adsorbate. The reaction kinetics implicate j3 - hydride elimination from alkyls bound to aluminum as the rate - determining step. When this rate - determining step is circumvented by adding atomic hydrogen to the system , alkylsilanes form at temperatures as low as 340 K. Our results show that the presence of metallic aluminum on the silicon surface is critical for ( I ) dissociatively adsorbing the alkyl iodide or aluminum alkyl , ( 2 ) inducing @ -hydride elimination of the adsorbed alkyls to form surface hydrogen atoms , and ( 3 ) enhancing the diffusion of hydrogen , alkyls , and silicon on the surface .	0

Abstract : The low - temperature molecular structure and electron density ( ED ) distribution of dioxane ( DIOX ) and trans- 2,5-dichloro-l,4-dioxane ( DICLOX ) were determined near 100 K from X-ray data. The geometry of the chlorinated molecule is in accord with the predictions of the anomeric effect. Electron deformation density ( EDD ) maps were calculated by Fourier and multipole expansion techniques and compared to those obtained by ab initio Hartree - Fock methods. The multipole model charge distribution of DIOX determined from experimental data was taken as a reference state , relative to which the ED of the substituted ring was analyzed. These fragment deformation density ( FDD ) maps show quadrupolar deformations which are strictly localized on the 0 , CI , and anomeric C atoms. The highly correlated orientation of the lobes at these atomic sites may indicate that the observed charge rearrangement is due to three - center interactions , although these local features of the FDD can not be interpreted on the basis of a specific molecular orbital coupling such as the n,(O)-o*(C-Cl) overlap. The quadrupoles at the 0 and at the CI atoms are situated in the C-0-C plane and parallel to it , respectively. This may imply that the u lone pair of the oxygen and the T lone pairs of the CI atom are also involved in the bonding .	0

Abstract : Titration calorimetry has been used to determine the effects of phosphine ligand basicity on the heats of protonation ( AHHM ) of the metal in the CpIr(CO)(PR,) and Fe(CO)3(PR3)2 complexes ( PRp = P @ -CIC6H4 ) , , PPh3 , P @ -MeOC6H & , PMePh2 , PMe2Ph , PMe , ) with CF,SO,H at 25.0 OC in 1,2-dichloroethane solvent. The AHHM values of the CpIr(CO)(PR3) to -33.2 kcal mol-I ( PR3 = PMe , ) , and those of the Fe(CO)3(PR3)2 compounds range from -29.2 ( PR , = P @ -CIC,H , ) , ) compounds range from -14.1 ( PR , = PPh , ) to -23.3 kcal mol- ’ ( PR3 = PMe3 ). Linear correlations of metal basicity ( A H H M ) with phosphine basicity ( AHHP or pK , ) show that increasing the phosphine basicity by 1 .O kcal mor1 increases the CpIr(CO)(PR,) basicity by 0.298 kcal mol- ’ and the Fe(C0),(PRJ2 basicity by 0.458 kcal mol- ’ per PR3 ligand. For both the Ir and Fe complexes , the AHHM values correlate linearly with the respective v(C0) values.

Diradicals. Treatment of 0.04 M solutions of carbodianions 2*-,2Li+ , 32-,2Li+ , and 42-,2Li+ in T H F with 1 molar equiv of iodine at 273 K for 15 min produces solutions of the corresponding diradicals 22* , 32* , and 42' ( Scheme II ). Io After a 1 0-fold dilution with 2-methyltetrahydrofuran ( 2- MeTHF ) or toluene , the solutions are examined by ESR spec- troscopy. The Ams = 1 regions of the ESR spectra at 100 K for diradicals 22* , 32' , and q2' consist of four symmetrical peaks , which are assigned to the triplet state with the approximate zero - field degeneracy , IE / hcl = 0.

radical mechanism for the inhibition process and the possibility of a single electron transfer ( SET ) route for M A 0 catalysis. Silverman 's proposal for inactivation by trans-2-phenylcyclo- propylamine ( 1 ) involves initial formation of a flavin anion rad- ical - amine cation radical intermediate by SET from 1 to the MAO - bound flavin. On the basis of an observation made earlier by Ingold " that cyclopropylaminyl radicals undergo fast ring- opening reactions , it was formulated that the cation radical 2 would open to produce the benzyl radical cation intermediate 3 , which then couples to a thiyl radical , itself generated by H - atom transfer to the flavin semiquinone radical ( Scheme I ). Further investi- gations by Silverman led to the suggestion that M A 0 inactivation by 1 -phenylcyclopropylamine 49 involves the formation , by a related sequence , of two enzyme - inhibitor covalent adducts.I0 In this case , the ring - opened radical 5 is suggested to bond to both a cysteine and the flavin moiety ( Scheme 11 ) .	0

Abstract : A novel hydrogen - bonding motif for the control of solid - state structures has been developed. The motif is based on the hydrogen bonding complementarity of carboxylic acids with 2-aminopyridine derivatives. Linking two aminopyridine groups through a rigid aromatic spacer provides a receptor unit that can complex dicarboxylic acids. When there is a good correspondence between the length of the spacer and that of the carboxylic acid , a discrete 1 : l complex is formed. When the dicarboxylic acid is longer than the receptor , an alternating hydrogen - bonded cocrystal occurs with the carboxylates on each diacid binding to different receptors. This motif dominates the cocrystal , forming even when the relative lengths of the diacid and the receptor change. Within the constraints of the alternating ribbon structure , the spatial position of the two components can be varied in a well - defined and predictable manner .	0
B. Synthesis of a,a - Disubstituted Amino Acids. We first ex- amined the enolate alkylation of a-methyl-substituted oxazinone 3a ( R = Me ) by employing method A ( Le. , enolate generation followed by electrophilic quenching ). Unfortunately , the ho- mologated products 7 were not detected. Even when potassium bis(trimethylsily1)amide and allyl iodide were used , none of the desired product 7 could be detected ; only decomposition of the starting material was observed. By employing the protocol de- scribed above ( method B ) involving addition of the base to a mixture of oxazinone containing the electrophile , the enolate alkylations of the a-methyl-substituted oxazinones 3a were re- alized , as shown in Scheme 111. First , sodium bis(trimethy1- silyl)amide was examined to determine whether it was reactive enough for the second alkylation. To a solution of 3a ( R = Me ) and allyl iodide in T H F / H M P A was added sodium bis(tri- methy1silyl)amide at -78 O C . The homologated oxazinone 7s ( R , = Me , R2 = allyl ) was detected only in trace amounts by TLC. The same procedure was performed with use of potassium bis- (trimethylsily1)amide instead of sodium bis(trimethylsily1)amide. After standard aqueous workup , the a-methyl-a-allyloxazinone 7a was produced in 57 % yield. This substance proved to be one diastereomer by ' H N M R analysis. If the solvating reagent HMPA is not used as the cosolvent , the yield is significantly enhanced ( 57 % to 87 % ). It is presumed that the employment of HMPA is not effective for the more reactive potassium enolates and only promotes decomposition .	0

The catabolism of GABA is catalyzed by the pyridoxal 5’- phosphate (PLP)-containing and a-ketoglutarate - dependent en- zyme , GABA aminotransferase ( EC 2.6.1.19 ) , to yield succinic semialdehyde and L-glutamate. An important treatment of ep- ileptic convulsions has focused on raising brain GABA levels by the irreversible inactivation of GABA aminotransferase. So far , this has been the most effective way to increase the presynaptic levels of GABA.*	0
On the basis of this mechanism , several mechanisms ( Schemes I , 11 , and IV ) can be envisaged for the inactivation of GABA aminotransferase by y-vinyl GABA ( 1 ). One mechanism ( Scheme I ) would involve azaallylic isomerization as described for the normal substrate. As in the case of GABA , Schiff base formation of 1 with the lysine - bound PLP would be followed by y-proton removal and azaallylic isomerization to give aldimine 6. Unlike the aldimine formed from GABA , however , 6 is a reactive Michael acceptor , and an active - site nucleophile could react with it to produce the covalent adduct 7 , which could be in equilibrium with two other adducts , 8 and 9.

dependence of the magnitude of the multiple quantum coherence in the HMQC experiment on the preparation period , ( 1 / 2f ) , nevertheless , cautions against excluding the possibility that the two coordinate Ag(1) sites identified in Figure 5 may be missing their connectivities to a third cysteine due to a very small ( < 5 Hz ) heteronuclear coupling constant. This uncertainty is un- fortunately not resolved by the near - equivalence in the H , proton chemical shifts for four cysteines ( C9 , C11 , C24 , C38 ) , Table I , which allowed for the unequivocal identification of only three ( C11 , C24 , C38 ) as bridging cysteines on the basis of observed con- nectivities to both of their H , protons. Thus , to account for the large Ag(1) chemical shift dispersion ( 460 ppm ) in Ag-MT , our present model invokes a mixed Ag(1) coordination number ( 2 and 3 ) involving 10 of the 12 cysteine thiols in this protein , with eight participating as bridging ligands and two as terminal ligands. The observation of only seven Ag(1) resonances for the re- constituted Ag-MT protein is at odds with the reported metal-	0

As the biological significance of glycosylation becomes in- creasingly evident,I the generation of reliable methods for the synthesis of complex oligosaccharides becomes even more im- portant.

The availability of stable , short a-helical peptides would provide useful frameworks for the design of biologically active small molecules as well as models for probing aspects of protein folding. Several approaches have recently been reported for stabilizing a-helical peptides including incorporation of salt bridges,' metal chelates,2 or amide bonds3 that bridge the i and i + 4 positions ; incorporation of amino acids with high helix propensity4 and helix caps ; $ and the formation of amphiphilic helix bundlesS6 One of the most successful strategies to date exploits the disulfide - bridged framework of the bee venom peptide , apamin , to generate chimeric a-helical peptides7 We now report the synthesis of short peptides containing a two - turn a-helix stabilized by a single intramolecular disulfide bond bridging the i and i + 7 residues ( Scheme I ).

We have reported multinuclear NMR analyses of the mode of interactions of c-dansyl-L-lysine ( 1 ) with an anti-dansyl mo- noclonal antibody ( 2 ) raised against dansyl keyhole limpet he- mocyanin.',* Table I summarizes the association constants for antibody 2 with a variety of dansyl haptens with different lengths of the side chain. This result indicates that the side chain attached to the dansyl ring is recognized by the hydrophobic subsite ' of antibody 2 and significantly contributes to the antigen binding. A transferred nuclear Overhauser effect ( TRNOE ) measurement4 has confirmed that the lysine side chain is folded when compound 1 is bound to antibody 2. On the basis of these results , attempts were made to use the hydrophobic subsife of antibody 2 as a chiral auxiliary for stereoselective organic reactions.

The visible absorption of blue copper proteins around 600 nm is considered to arise from a sulfur ( Cys ) to Cut1 charge - transfer transition.17 and accordingly , RR spectra obtained with 600-nm excitation can be attributed mainly to the CulI-S stretching mode.*bJOql ' The 830-nm absorption of CU , is also considered to arise from a similar transition of the CU , center,I3 and hence we tentatively assign the most intense and deuteration insensitive band at 330 cm-I to a mode mainly associated with a Cul % ( Cys ) stretching vibration of CU , and the weak and deuteration sensitive band at 356 cm-' to the Cu - N(His) stretching vibration. The Cu-S stretching bands of blue copper proteins with a single cysteine ligand exhibit complicated patterns of D 2 0 shifts,8b,'1b which are explained in terms of vibrational mixing of the Cu-S with Cu-N stretching modes. Normal coordinate calculations of the Cu center of blue copper proteins indicate significant mixing of the CuII-S with the Cu " -N stretching modes.8b.18 Therefore , it is highly likely that Cu , - associated RR bands are mixed modes of the Cu-N and Cu-S stretching vibrations.

Abstract : ESR experiments on an X-irradiated single crystal of enantiomerically pure bis(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)phosphinic chloride ( Ar,P(O)CI ) reveal the formation of the corresponding phosphoryl radical ( la , Ar2PO ) via a dissociative electron - capture reaction of the PCI bond. At 120 K , this radical exhibits an exclusive and enantioselective stereoinversion in the single - crystal matrix leading to the phosphoryl radical structure lb. This process was monitored in detail using anisotropic ESR spectroscopy combined with X-ray crystallographic data. An analysis of the nonbonded steric interactions demonstrates that the stereoinversion is controlled intramolecularly and occurs in a synchronous reorientation of the PO bond and two methyl groups of the ortho tert-butyl substituents. Besides the stereoinversion , other radical reactions are observed in the crystal matrix. Ab initio quantum chcmical calculations are employed to assess the electronic structure of the phosphoryl radical in more detail. An ROHF / 6-31G* gcomctry optimization within C , symmetry constraints yields two equilibrium structures which basically differ by their PO bond length ( 1.478 and 1.616 A ).

Recent synthetic strategies in our group have allowed for the high - yield preparation of divalent mononuclear rhodium com- plexes. These systems all have in common the presence of an unusual phosphine with the combined characteristics of high basicity , large size , and functionality. The ligand , tris(2,4,6- trimethoxypheny1)phosphine ( TMPP ) , which was reported as long ago as 1959 by Soviet chemists , ’ has not been widely used in transition - metal chemistry despite its ease of preparation , stability , and inherently desirable properties for stabilizing unusual reaction centers. In fact , we know of only two reports of complexes containing the TMPP ligand ; these are [ M(TMPP)J+ ( M = Cu , Ag ) and CuX(TMPP) ( X = CI , Br ). 3 Organic chemists , Wada and co-workers , reintroduced the ligand to the recent literature , with reports of mild ring - opening reactions of terminal epoxides ’ and extraordinarily facile dealkylation reactions , findings that could lead to applications in catalytic polymerization of olefins and in Michael additions4 Clearly , the extreme nucleophilicity of the phosphorus lone pair imparts unusual reactivity to this tertiary phosphine .	0
In this paper , we report that the oxidation of CpRu(C0)- (PMe,)H ( 1 ) appears to result in an initial proton transfer analogous to that shown in eq 2. However , in this case the dinuclear bridging hydride [ CpRu(C0)(PMe,)l2(p-H)' is the predominant oxidation product in addition to the dihydrogen complex CpRu(CO)(PMe3)(q2 - HJt. Experimental evidence will be presented that suggests that the dinuclear hydride arises from a radical / cation radical coupling reaction between CpRu- (CO)(PMe3)* and CpRu(CO)(PMe,)H*+. Fine - tuning of the experimental conditions causes the oxidation to proceed as a 2 / 3- , 1- , or 2-electron process , leading to different product mixtures. Despite the apparent complexity of this system , all results may be well - explained in terms of a primary proton transfer from 1 " . Results	0

Abstract : The reaction of RU(NH ~ ) ~ OH ? + with CoP(py) , ( cobalt meso-tetrakis(4-pyridy1)porphyrin ) within Nafion coatings on graphite electrodes produces [ COP( ~ ~ RU(NH ~ ) ~ ),]*'. This complex , immobilized within the polyelectrolyte coating , achieves electronic contact with the electrode underlying the coating by means of electron hopping between adjacent pairs of R u ( N H ~ ) ~ ~ + / ~ + groups coordinated to the pyridine sites. The four Ru(NH ~ ) ~ PY'+' ~ + groups in each molecule do not interact strongly and have essentially the same formal potential. The CoP(pyRu(NH3),),8+ complex acts as a catalyst for the four - electron reduction of O2 under conditions where mixtures of the same porphyrin with uncoordinated Ru(NH,) , ~ + or Ru(NH3),py2+ do not. The results provide evidence for the intramolecular delivery of four electrons from the four - coordinated R u ( N H ~ ) ~ ~ + groups to O2 molecules associated with the Co(l1) center of the porphyrin .	0

Abstract : Photoenolization of 1-methylanthraquinone ( AQ ) and its deuterated analogue ( AQ-d , ) has been studied by laser flash photolysis over a wide temperature range ( 120-340 K ). Phototransfer of a H ( or D ) atom has been found to occur in both the singlet and triplet n r * states. The temperature dependence of the efficiency of the phototransfer of H and D atoms in the Inr* state has been analyzed. Piperylene quenching of AQ and AQ-d , triplet excited states has been studied. The rate constants of H- and D - atom phototransfer at room temperature have been estimated to be ca. 3 X IO'O s-I and ca. 1Olo s-I > respectively. Quantum - chemical calculations of potential energy surfaces and of electronic and geometrical structures of kcy intcrmediates have been performed by using the AM1 technique. A triplet o , ? r-biradical has been found to be the intermediate preceding the formation of 9-hydroxy-I ,IO-anthraquinone-I-methide ( AQM ). It has been revealed that thermal transformation of the enol AQM to the initial quinone AQ can occur as an intramolecular process via reverse transfer of a H atom , or as a second - order reaction. The latter appears to involve the transfer of two H ( or D ) atoms in a collisional complex of two AQM molecules. The dependence of the rate constants of the intramolecular thermal transfer of H and D atoms on temperature and solvent nature has been analyzed .	0
Deoxy-Mb thus obtained is reoxidized to met-Mb by adding another 0.04 mM of the quinone. This cycle is repeated three times , until NADH is completely consumed by the quinone. The reduction of met-Mb could be induced again by additional injection of NADH .	0
As the amount of alkyl substitution on the a-aryl group in- creases , the quantum yield for cyclization decreases. Although quantum yields for most ketone reactions are dominated by bi- radical partitioning : , such is not the case here. Very little dis- proportionation back to ground - state ketone occurs , and enolization is a competing product - forming reaction only with 7. Therefore , we conclude that another internal chemical reaction must partially quench the triplets of these ketones. We believe that C T com- plexation is the most likely culprit. Internal C T quenching of n,r triplets by P-phenyl groups is known to be very rapid ( k = IO9 s-l)51 and appears to be rotationally controlled because of the favorable orbital overlap possible.52 Similar quenching by an a-aryl group is slower because of increased ring strain and poorer orbital overlap , a condition that can be offset by increased elec- tron - donating ability of the aryl group. We considered testing our system with p-methoxy substituents , but the experiment has	0
In the accompanying paper , we describe the facile photo- cyclization of several a-(o-toly1)acetophenones to 2-indanols.' The reaction proceeds by rapid triplet - state & hydrogen abstraction that generates 1,Sbiradical intermediates. These have 20-50-11s lifetimes and undergo cyclization in very high efficiency ( 80-100 % ). Increased alkyl substitution on the a-tolyl group lowers the quantum yield of cyclization ; this fact suggests that some CT quenching of the triplet can compete with hydrogen abstraction .	0

4. Consequently , [20]'+ is not directly observed. The interme- diacy of [20]'+ , however , is implied both by the kinetics of the reactions and by the results of ion ejection experiments. Such an experiment is illustrated in Figure 1 for the reaction of 1 " with NO2' , which is analogous to the 2 " reaction with NOz'. The reactant ion is produced by pulsed laser desorption and stored in the ion trap. A pulsed valvef2 then opens and admits a burst of NO2' following which spectrum l a is obtained revealing a sub- stantial [lNO]+ product. Spectrum l b is obtained under identical conditions except that an rf voltage is applied to the cell to eject ions of the mass of [lo]'+ continuously during the NO2' burst.13 Even though [lo]'+ can not be detected , it can be ejected.I4 Obviously from spectrum 1 b , eliminating [lo]'+ eliminates [ lNO]+ , supporting the intermediacy of the former in producing the latter .	0

quently , since benzofulvene appears to aromatize via the six- membered - ring carbenes 4 and 5 , rather than via the indenyl carbene 2 ( vida supra ) , it follows that all four of the other transition states in Scheme I must likewise lie lower in energy than the transition states separating 2 from either la or 16. The lowest energy pathway between la and 18 in Scheme I , therefore , is la - 4 = 3 F = 5 = = 1p. All the experimental and theoretical evidence to date is con- sistent with ( but does not " prove " ) this pathway for the autom- erization of naphthalene. One can not exclude the direct ' dyotropic " rearrangementz3 of naphthalene to benzofulvene ( simultaneous carbon and hydrogen shifts ) , bypassing carbene intermediates entirely , but in either case , benzofulvene would be an obligatory intermediate in the naphthalene automerization. Alternative pathways involving reversible isomerization of naphthalene to azulene or to isonaphthvalene have already been di ~ proven. ~ ~ ' We conclude , therefore , that the thermal autom- erization of naphthalene probably occurs by reversible formation of benzofulvene , either via carbenes 4 and 5 or by direct dyotropic rearrangements .	0

Contrary to many radical reductions , the configuration of the substrate iodide has a significant effect on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction ( Table 11 ). Iodides in which the alkoxy group and iodo moiety are anti ( 1 , 3 , 9 , 12 ) show a marked preference for producing erythro products when Mg12 is present while compounds in which the alkoxy and iodo groups are syn ( 2 , 4)12 show a modest preference for the threo isomer in the presence of MgI,. The syn and anti iodides react identically in the absence of MgIz producing selectively the threo products ( entries 2 and 4 ). 5b One could rationalize these results by sug- gesting that the chelated form of the syn iodide is less reactive than the anti iodide in the initial phase of the reaction ( C-I strain in the transition state. In breakage ) due to developing the case of syn iodides , the unchelated pathway would therefore be more energetically favored .	0
We report here the first photoinduced charge transfer between a semiconductor ( ZnO ) cluster and a carbon cluster. The reduced clusters of c 6 0 and C70 exhibit absorption characteristics that are quite different from the photogenerated triplet excited states. Transient absorption studies which describe the formation of C,- and C70- in optically excited ZnO suspensions are presented here. It has been shown that c 6 0 and C70 clusters can be reduced electrochemically up to five successive electron reductions.I4 The first reduction occurs at a potential of -0.44 V vs SCE. Efforts have been made recently to characterize the absorption spectra of reduced products by steady - state spectroelectrochemica13 and y-radiolysiss experiments.

for the stilbazolium - type chromophore defined in Scheme 1.7-9 In this layered intercalation compound , the inorganic MnPS3 host lattice acquires a spontaneous magnetization below about 35 K , and the inserted organic DAMS chromophores spontane- ously pack in a non-centrosymmetrical way , forming extended J - type aggregates which bring about a large hyperpolarizability.7 However , despite its interest , this material possesses a rather weak magnetization ; hence , there is still a need for developing other families of compounds that would display stronger magnetization .	0
A planar conformation for the cyclohexene ring is energetically not favored both because of the eclipsing of the neighboring methylene groups and because the C-C-C ring angles in a planar ring must be close to 120 ° rather than the desired tetrahedral value. Another unfavorable conformation results if the ring twists about the double bond , perturbing the a system. The lowest energy conformations result from a ring - bending , which gives rise to a boat structure , and from a ring - twisting , which gives rise to a half - chair form. In 1948 Beckett , Freeman , and Pitzer , used conformational calculations to predict that the lowest energy structure of cyclohexene should have a twisted form. This C2 conformation was estimated to be 2.7 kcal / mol more stable than the bent form. More than a decade later , Anet and Haq4 con- cluded from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments that the bent structure of cyclohexene exists only as a transition state and not as a second conformer. These workers also estimated that the A H for the half - chair to boat interconversion is 5.3 kcal / mol. Liquid and solid infrared and liquid Raman spectra of cyclohexene and its dIo isotopomer were reported5 in 1967 ; one year later the microwave spectrum6 showed the molecule to be twisted. The twist angle was reported to be 30 f 2'. The gas - phase Raman	0
An estimation of the secondary structural elements of a protein may be obtained by the analysis of its CD spectrum ( below 240 nm ). 6a The first effort along these lines was the study of Greenfield and Fasman.6b The analysis is generally based on the determination and empirical correlation of measured CD spectra with major secondary structural elements. The linear combination of the weighted " pure CD component " curves can yield the measured CD spectra of complex structures. Besides the two major secondary structural elements composed of recurring conformational subunits such as helices ( a-helix , 3 , , , helix , and a-helix ) ( 4 , = -60 " * 30 ° , = -60 " f 30 ° ) and the different forms of @ -pleated sheets ( 4 , = -1 50 " f 30 ° , PI = + 150 ° f 30 ° ) , a third frequently found typical structural unit in globular proteins is the @ - turn c ~ nformation. ~ This third secondary structure is made up of subunits of nonrecurring conformations.

1-Phenyl- 1,3-butadiyne is one of very few examples in which a phenyl ring is conjugated with the diacetylene chromophore and yet often undergoes smooth polymerization ( Scheme I ). * We report here the synthesis of 1 -phenyl- 1,3-butadiyne derivatives ( 3 and 4 ) , carrying a hydroxyamino and a stable nitroxide group at the meta position on the phenyl ring , respectively , their po- lymerization in the solid state , and the magnetic properties of the polymer sample^.^ Results	0
The addition of a series of nucleophiles to the nitroalkene 1 were examined , and the results are summarized in Scheme I1 and Table I. All of the nucleophiles examined provided substituted phenyl thiolesters with good to excellent diastereoselectivities. The de- termination of the configuration of the major diastereoisomer was accomplished either by conversion to known compounds or by solution of single - crystal X-ray data. Products 6a-c were cleanly converted into the methyl esters 8a-c using methanolic mercuric acetate ( Scheme III ). * The configuration of ether 8a was de- termined to be C-5(S) by comparison with authentic material prepared via the methylation of the known a-hydroxy methyl ester 9a5 using a vast excess of diazomethane solution in the presence of silica gel as c a t a l y ~ t . ~ Compound 8b was debenzylated by catalytic hydrogenolysis over palladium black to afford 9a ( 89 % ). Determination of the configuration of 8c was accomplished by reduction of the known azide 9b5 by hydrogenation over palladium and subsequent toluene-4-sulfonylation to give an authentic sample of 8c ( 71 % ). Finally an X-ray crystallographic structural study of the major succinimide adduct established its structure as the C-5 ( R ) isomer ( Figure 2 ). 1 ° It is clear from these results that both succinimide and phthalimide showed opposite stereochemical bias to alkoxide nucleophiles and toluene-4-sulfonamide .	0
Abstract : The reaction of 1,3-butadiene with atomically adsorbed oxygen on Ag(ll0) has been studied with use of tem- perature - programmed reaction mass spectrometry. Oxygen adds to C , and C4 of 1,3-butadiene via a reaction that is formally a chelotropic 1,4- ~ ycloaddition. 2,5-Dihydrofuran and furan , the cycloaddition products , evolve into the gas phase at 465 K. Other reaction products are water , carbon dioxide , 2(5H)-furanone , maleic anhydride , 4-vinylcyclohexene , and styrene. The reaction of oxygen and 1,3-butadiene on Ag(ll0) resembles a number of other reactions in which simultaneous bond making and breaking occur on the pathway leading from reactants to products. Among these reactions are the epoxidation of norbornene and styrene on silver , the Diels - Alder dimerization of 1,3-butadiene on clean Ag(1 lo ) , and the trimerization of acetylene to benzene on Pd(ll1) and Cu( 110 ). We propose ( i ) that these reactions are all formally related , ( ii ) that they may also be mechanistically related , and ( iii ) that they be classified as surface - mediated cycloaddition processes .	0

The intrinsic bamers for the analogous carbon - centered systems are also of considerable interest. Hiatt and BensonZS have esti- mated activation energies for gas - phase halogen atom transfer of alkyl systems of -10 ( Cl ) , -6 ( Br ) , and 2-4 ( I ) kcal mol-'. With X = I , the ' self - exchange " process is sufficiently rapid in alcohol solvents to lead to epimerization of the norbornyl iodide starting material.26 Studies of alkyl radical / alkyl halide transfer in benzene suggest transfer rates at zero driving force of ca. lo2 ( X = Cl ) , lo3 ( X = Br ) , and los ( X = I ) M-I s-l at 50 0C.27 Since the Mc-Cl ( 72.4 f 0.9 kcal / mol19 ) and CCl3-C1 ( 68.9 f 0.7 kcal / molZ8 ) bond energies are very similar , our data ( Table I ) implicate a greater intrinsic barrier for the C1 transfer to the Mo radical from CCl , than for the entirely metal - centered process.

Despite the synthetic usefulness of radical cyclization reactions,' the cyclization pathway is mainly limited to 5-exo closure along with somewhat less efficient 6-ex0 and 6-endo closure due to stereoelectronic and geometric reasons.2 A fundamentally new approach for the formation of five- and six - membered - ring radicals from acyclic precursors was sought , and we report here an un- precedented radical cyclization using 2-phenyl-N-aziridinyl imines which we believe has considerable synthetic potential for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds.

Abstract : Peroxynitrite reacts with morpholine ( MorH ) to give both N-nitromorpholine ( Mor - NO2 ) and N-nitrosomorpholine ( Mor - NdO ). The pH profile of Mor - NO2 formation shows a bell - shaped curve with a maximum yield of 1.6 mol % ( relative to peroxynitrite ) centered around pH 9.0. Yields of Mor - NdO , on the other hand , increase until the pH reaches 10.0 and then reach a plateau ; the maximum yield of Mor - NdO is 12 mol % relative to peroxynitrite. Both the nitration and nitrosation of MorH are catalyzed by low levels of CO2 ; however , excess CO2 dramatically reduces the yields of Mor - NdO but not Mor - NO2 , and the combined yields of Mor - NdO and Mor - NO2 are about the same under conditions of high and low concentrations of CO2. These data indicate that both nitration and nitrosation by peroxynitrite are free radical processes. The morpholine radical ( Mor¥ ) , formed from the reactions of carbonate and / or hydroxyl radicals with MorH , reacts with either ¥NO or ¥NO2 and serves as a common precursor for Mor - NdO and Mor - NO2 .	0
was fine , the ee was only 34 % ( entry 1 ). Tightening the pocket by switching to the naphtho linker as in ligand 56b dramatically increased the enantioselectivity to 84 % ee ( entry 2 ). Two additional optimization experiments proved quite interesting. In the first , removal of any exogeneous base further increased the selectivity to 92 % ee. In the second , lowering the catalyst loading to 1 % ( no attempt to reduce this loading further was made ) also increased the selectivity to 95 % .6 In this way , a nearly quantitative yield of the O - alkylated product 3 of 95 % ee was isolated. Switching to the six - membered ring nucleophile 1b led to a more sluggish reaction and required 40 ( cid : 176 ) C but still gave an excellent ee ( 96 % ). The six - membered ring electrophile 2b showed a parallel trend ( see eq 2 ). 7	0

Among the many criteria for mechanistic plausibility in organic transformations , the most fundamental is thermochemical. The enthalpy or free energy change in each step of a proposed mechanism must conform to reasonable expectations for that mechanism to be accepted for a given reaction. Accordingly , estimation schemes for the heats of formation of reactive inter- mediates , for which experimental thermochemical data are sparse , are widely used. These schemes , such as Benson 's group equiv- alents,2 are usually based on an additivity assumption. Even the correction for systematic errors in ab initio heats of formation3 by calculation of a homcdesmotic reaction relies upon an implicit assumption of additive increments to AHf by component parts of a molecule. Used properly , group or bond additivity schemes adequately predict AHf for closed - shell molecules , and even for organic radical^,^ to within a few kcal / mol. For carbenes and biradicals though , additivity has a mixed record of predictions , of which the best one can say is that the predictions rest upon no solid thermochemical database and are of uncertain reliability. This uncertainty rests at the very crux of mechanistic controversies in which the plausibility of a carbene or biradical intermediate along a reaction coordinate is judged by an estimate of AHf for that putative intermediate.5 The uncertainty in Ur[carbene or biradical ] is equivalent to saying that , while we can predict the bond dissociation energy in a molecule to give a radical , we can not predict with certainty the second bond dissociation energy which takes that radical to a carbene or biradical .	0
Abstract : Difluorocyclopropenone was prepared by gas - phase photolysis of difluoromaleic anhydride and was characterized spectroscopically. It is unstable at room temperature but may be stored for long periods of time at -78 OC. Microwave spectra of the normal and I8O isotopomer for difluorocyclopropenone were measured. The structural parameters were determined to be r(CIO) = 1.192 A , r(CICI) = 1.453 A , r(C2C3) = 1.324 A , and r(CF) = 1.314 A , and the electric dipole moment was found to be 2.32 D. Ab initio calculations at the CISD / 6-31G* level are reported for cyclopropenone , difluorocyclopropenone , and related cyclopropenes and are in good agreement with the experimental results. The experimental geometry and ab initio computations indicate that difluorocyclopropenone enjoys a resonance energy comparable to that of the parent compound .	0
other Observations. Detection of the acyliminium ion from 5d was tried by using BF3.0Me2 , TMSOTf , and Tf20. However , such a species could not be detected in CDC1 , at -55 OC. The iminium ion derived from 5e was detected at -55 OC with the aid of Tf20 , and the ratio of the iminium ion to 5e was 1 : 4. Under the same conditions , 5a gave the ratio of 1OO : O. Treatment of 5f with 1 equiv of BF,.0Me2 produced the ratio of 1 : 3. Ac- cordingly , it is clear that electron - donating groups such as Me and OMe stabilize the intermediate , while electron - withdrawing groups such as NO2 destabilize the iminium ion. Normally , 6a was produced in CDCI,. Formation of 6a in CD2C12 was much faster than its formation in CDC13 , indicating that the equilibrium was affected by the solvent .	0
Such a process must involve the cleavage of at least one co- ordinative bond of the alkalimetal ion to a cyclopentadienide ligand , resulting in a not completely coordinated contact ion pair species in the transition state. The formation of such a species should possess a large activation enthalpy A P and also a positive value for the activation entropy A S , due to the increase in the number of degrees of freedom. In fact , the comparison of the 'H N M R signal line shapes of two different protons ( one belonging to the ferrocene moiety ( H-4 ) , the other belonging to the cyclo- pentadienide rings ( H- 1 1 ) ) with those obtained from numerical simulation ' allowed the determination of AH* and AS* ( Figure 1)* for the decoordination process :	0
but a few recent reports have dealt with radicals centered on group IV elements other than as well as on phosphorus,14 sulfur,15 and oxygen.16 There have also been several time - resolved studies of micellized radical ion pairs ( see the review by Steiner6 for examples ).

In the case of cyclobutene , the addition of strongly donating Lewis bases ( PMe3 , PMe,Ph , or PEt , ) is necessary to reverse the relative magnitudes of the observed rates of initiation and prop- agation. For example , the polymerization of cyclobutene catalyzed by 1 yields polymer with high polydispersity index in the presence of THF or 2-Me-THF , probably because the ligands bind not much differently to initiating and propagating species.

Effects on A H H M of Other Bdentate Ligands in Fe(CO),(LZ ). The free bidentate l i g a n d ~ ~ ~ s ~ ~ in complexes 5-7 are somewhat weaker donor ligands than dppe , as measured by their AHH , values This results from the relatively electron - withdrawing ( Table I ). 4b bridging groups , l,2-C6H4 in dppbz and cis-CH = CH in cis-dppv , and the poorer donor ability of the AsPhz group in arphos. Despite the weaker donating abilities of these ligands , complexes 5-7 have AHHM values that are essentially the same as that ( -23.2 kcal mol-' ) of Fe(C0)3(dppe ). It appears that it is the chelate ring size of 5 which is common to these complexes , and , among com- plexes with similar ligand AHHp values , it is the chelate ring size which is the most important factor controlling the A H H M values of the complexes ( Figure 1 ). As discussed above , the chelate ring size affects the amount of distortion in the complex and therefore the basicity of the metal. That the dppe and dppbz ligands induce similar degrees of distortion is supported by X-ray structures of 29c and 5 " which have P-Fe-P angles of 84.1' and 85.8O , re- spectively .	0

The main experimental problem with trapping experiments is the necessity to find a reagent which combines sufficiently fast with the intermediate.

If either of the two arms of the intermediate adds to the polymerizable compound , a chain polymerization is started , The intermediate thus acts as an initiator of polymerization , with its other arm bearing the counterion or another radical .	0

elements. From time - resolved fluorescence studies,3c K was es- timated to be ( 1290 f 230 ) M- ’ for interaction between 1 and 2. This value is comparable to that obtained with 1Oa and 11 and is consistent with the steady - state data ( Figure 2 ). Blocking the cytosine amino group ( i.e. , using 9 with 1 ) reduces K to ( 410 f 70 ) M- ’ but does not alter the photochemical behavior ; the derived rate constant for electron transfer is ( 3.7 f 0.8 ) X lo8 s-’. Since “ blocking ” reduces the observed binding constant for cytosine- guanine base - pairing between lob and 11 ( K = ( 1 80 f 30 ) M-l ) , these data are further consistent with the model presented in Figure 1. Thus , the present study introduces a base - paired system capable of effecting specific , but noncovalent , long - range elec- tron - transfer processes .	0

Although it has been shown in a number of reports that intermediates such as 2 and 3 are involved in iron(III) porphyrin complex - catalyzed oxygenations of hydrocarbons , is not completely clear which reactive species ( e.g. , 2 , 3 , or both 2 and 3 at the same time ) are responsible for oxygen atom transfer in the catalytic oxygenation reactions performed at room temperature and what factors are important to determine the nature of the reactive intermediates in iron porphyrin model systems. In this paper , we report the results of the competitive epoxidations studied with cis- and trans-stilbenes and with cyclooctene and trans-stilbene in iron(III) porphyrin - catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by oxidants such as H2O2 , tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( t-BuOOH ) , and m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid ( m-CPBA ) in protic and aprotic solvents at room temperature. We found from the studies that both the intermediates ( i.e. , 2 and 3 ) indeed function as reactive species in the epoxidation of olefins by iron porphyrins at room temperature and that the participation of 2 and 3 as reactive epoxidizing intermediates is found to be controlled by the factors such as the solvent system ( i.e. , protic and aprotic solvents ) , the presence of a proton source in aprotic solvent , and the acidity of alcohol solvents. Furthermore , we report for the first time that a high - valent iron(IV) oxo porphyrin cation radical intermediate containing nonbulky ortho-fluoro substituents at the phenyl groups of electron - deficient porphyrin ligand shows an unexpected prefer- ence for trans-stilbene over cis-stilbene in the competitive epoxidations of cis- and trans-stilbenes .	0

Abstract : The tetramer of lithium 3,5-dimethylphenolate in diethyl ether undergoes sequential solvation by H M P A and is fully converted to the H M P A tetrasolvate by 1 equiv of the cosolvent. Addition of 8 equiv of H M P A does not cause dissociation of the tetramer. Addition of HMPA to lithium p-bromo- and p-(trifluoromethy1)phenolates in THF results in conversion of their dimers to tetramers and , at high cosolvent ratios , monomers. Two equivalents of H M P A in either THF or diethyl ether converts dimeric lithium 2,6-dimethylphenolate to the monomer. 13C , ' Li , and 3iP chemical shifts for the various H M P A solvates are reported. The 7Li quadrupole splitting constant for tetrameric lithium 3,5-dimethylphenolate H M P A tetrasolvate is 35 kHz. Lithium p-bromophenolate in THF at -120 OC forms a small quaritity of a trimer together with the dimer and tetramer .	0

Abstract : The citrate ion gives rise to four different methylene proton chemical shifts in the presence of (S)-lactate and Pr3+. Trimethyl citrate behaves similarly in the presence of (S)-2,2,2-trifluoro-l-(9-anthryl)ethanoL The four methylene shifts have been assigned in an absolute way by comparisons with those from the corresponding spectra of (2R,3R)-citrate-2-d and trimethyl (2R,3R)-citrate-2-d , respectively. The chemical shifts of the three methyl groups in trimethyl citrate in the presence of the anthryl shift reagent have also been assigned. Deuterium isotope effects on the proton chemical shifts of these molecules have been determined. In the absence of shift reagents these effects are mainly of the intrinsic type , but in their presence there are equilibrium perturbation contributions. The IH NMR line widths and chemical shifts in the citrate-lactate-PrC1 , system depend strongly on the pH , spectrometer frequency , and temperature , with the best results obtained at room temperature , pH = 3.8 , and a spectrometer frequency of 200 MHz .	0
Abstract : Photochromism of a spironaphthopyran ( l'-(methoxyethyl)-3',3',5'-trimethyl-spiro[2H-l -naphthopyran-2,2'-indoline ] ) is studied with picosecond transient absorption and picosecond time - resolved resonance Raman spectroscopies. A photochromic reaction occurring within 50 ps after ultraviolet ( 287 nm ) irradiation produces merocyanine species which absorb at 574 nm in both polar and nonpolar solvents. For as long as 1.5 ns , neither absorption nor resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals any changes in the merocyanine isomer ( s ) initially formed. In polar solvents , a second transient absorption ( 400-460 nm ) appears both before the merocyanine isomer ( s ) is formed and whenever the merocyanine isomer ( s ) is excited at 574 nm. No back - reaction from the merocyanine isomer ( s ) to the spiro form is observed when the sample is irradiated at either 574 or 425 nm with delays of 100 ps to 1 ns after 287-nm excitation. A reaction mechanism describing spiropyran photochromism is suggested from these results .	0

Abstract : Atom - resolved atomic force microscope ( AFM ) images of underpotentially deposited ( upd ) monolayers of Ag on Au(ll1) are presented. These images show that the structure of this monolayer is dependent on the nature of the electrolyte in which the upd process occurs. Specifically , Ag shows a 3 X 3 overlayer in sulfuric acid and a 4 X 4 overlayer in nitrate- and carbonate - containing electrolytes. In perchloric acid a more complex structure is observed which , like the sulfate and nitrate systems , is also not close packed. In acetate , a close - packed monolayer is formed. The different monolayer structures give rise to packing densities which correlate with electrolyte size , except in the case of perchloric acid. However , there is little agreement between packing densities predicted from coulometric measurements and those actually observed with the AFM. The discrepancy between the two measurements is ascribed to differing amounts of charge transfer between electrolyte and adatom which alters the amount of charge needed for upd lattice formation .	0

For nickel and copper the rather low energy of the open structure ( Table I ) indicates that this structure could be an in- termediate in the reaction of the metal and epoxide to give a metallaoxetane. An SN2 - type attack by the metal on the carbon followed by rotation around the carbon-carbon double bond and formation of a metal-oxygen bond would give the metallacycle. Stereochemical studies would be necessary to distinguish this SNZtype oxidative addition from a three - center oxidative addition of the carbon-oxygen bond to the metal. Studies of the reaction of specifically deuterated epoxide ( 2 and 4 ) , C 0 2 and copper(I),' nickel(O),' or platinum(II)8 complexes have shown that the cleavage of the C-0 bond by the metal is stereospecific for copper and platinum but nonstereospecific for nickel. In the copper case formation of a cyclic carbonate 6 from epoxide 2 with retention of the overall stereochemistry can be interpreted as a double inversion involving an SN2 - type oxidative addition ( Scheme II ). ' In the platinum case an SNZtype oxidative addition with inversion at carbon was unambiguously established by the isolation of metallacycle 5. Conclusions	0
UV excitation of nitrite anions in anaerobic aqueous solution leads to NO ' and HO ' radicals'- ) ( eq 1 ). The hydroxyl radical may recombine with NO ' giving H N 0 2 ( eq 2 ) or be scavenged by nitrite anions at a diffusion - controlled rate to yield OH- and NO2' ( eq 3 ). NO ' and NO2' may react to give N2O3 ( eq 4 ) which hydrolyzes to regenerate nitrite4 ( eq 5 ). Thus no apparent chemical change is observed during anaerobic photolysis. How- ever , in air saturated solution , NO ' may be competitively oxidized by oxygen which leads to oxygen depletion5 and the formation of nitrate ( eq 6 ) .	0

Abstract : Methylcobalamin ( MeCbl , MeB12 ) thermolyzed in ethylene glycol from 120 to 141 OC with 2,2,6,6-tetra- methylpiperidinyl-1-oxy ( TEMPO ) as a Me ' trap gives the homolysis products Co1IBIzr and TEMPO-Me quantitatively. The 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole axial-base-off-base-on equilibrium in ethylene glycol has an enthalpy change of -5.1 ( f 2 ) kcal mol-' and an entropy change of -10.5 ( f 4 ) cal mol-' K-' , equilibrating between the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole - coordinated base-on form and the two distinct yet similar non-coordinated forms : the base - off and the so - called " tuck-in " forms. The MeB12 C d H , homolysis rates indicate an activation enthalpy of 41 f 3 kcal mol-' , an activation entropy of 24 f 6 cal mol-' K-I , and an estimated methylcob(II1)alamin Co-CH , bond dissociation energy of 37 f 3 kcal mol-'. This is the strongest Co-C cobamide bond measured. Comparison of the MeCbl homolysis rate constant s-' ) extrapolated to -30 OC with the known reduced-methylcobamide-radical-anion values indicates rate enhancements of ( at -30 " C ) following elec- trochemical reduction , or still over 10I5 at 25 OC. Such reduction provides an antibonding electron which weakens the Co-C bond from 37 kcal mol-' down to ca. 12 kcal mol-'. These rate enhancements are greater than the analogous enzyme - induced Co-C cleavage rate enhancements in adenosylcobalamin ( Coenzyme BIZ , AdoCb1 ) - dependent enzymes. However , electron transfer is not predicted for the mechanism of any adenosylcobalamin - dependent or methylcobalamin - dependent enzymes .	0

Abstract : Eosin , Eo2- , and N,N’-dimethyl-4,4’-bipyridinium , MV2+ , form a crystalline 1 : 1 complex [ Eo2 -- MV2+]. With N,N’-dibenzyL4,4’-bipyridinium , BV2+ , the dye Eo2- forms a crystalline complex where one BV2+ unit is intercalated between two Eo2- units and the second BVZ+ unit is positioned outside this sandwich structure [ Eo2 -- BV2+-EoZ- ; BV2+]. Electrostatic , charge - transfer , and a interactions stabilize these intermolecular assemblies. In solution , Eo2- and MV2+ initially form the 1 : 1 intermolecular structure [ Eo2 -- MV2+]. The latter complex is transformed to the thermodynamically stable complex structure [ Eo2 -- MV2+-Eo2- ; MV2+ ] ( in DMF , k = 57.3 M-l s-I at 331 K and E , = 25.3 f 0.5 kcal mol- ’ ). The 1 : l complex [ Eo2 -- MV2+ ] shows thermal population of the charge - transfer band .	0

The aromatic coupling partners were synthesized from a com- mon starting material , 2,4,6-trihydroxybenmic acid ( 8 ). Reaction of 8 with acetone in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid-tri- fluoroacetic anhydride afforded the 1,3-benzodioxin 9. Specific protection of the 4-hydroxyl group was accomplished by a Mit- sunobu protocol.6 Compound 10 , thus obtained in 92 % yield , was converted to aryl triflate 11 through the agency of triflic anhydride-pyridine.' Cross coupling of 11 with 1-heptyne ( bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride , triethylamine- DMF)8 afforded a 68 % yield of 12. Compound 12 lent itself to conversion to a variety of useful intermediates.

From Figure 16 , @ 3 mA at [TS] = is 48 % , and the resulting value of ki , is 4.6 X lo9 M-I s-l . Al ternatively , kism can be calculated from the value of SAkiscts obtained from the IO2 quantum yield measurements ( Table 11 ). SA is 70 % ( see accompanying paper ) , giving a value of kiscts = 6.5 X lo9 M-I s-I , which would give a of 67 % at [TS] = m. These numbers calculated value for hDCA are in reasonable agreement , considering the errors , and show that TS induces intersystem crossing in DCA with high efficiency in benzene .	0

Since the racemization and isomerization proceed through a common ring - opened intermediate , i , the ratio of products formed , (f)-trans-II / (f)-cis-11 , is determined by the ratio of the rate constants for ring closure to both the trans and cis ketyls , kc,uans / kc,cis ( eqs 11 and 12 , Scheme 11 ). A steady - state treatment of the reactions in Scheme 11 , with the assumption that at low conversion spin exchange between the ketyl and the neutral ketone ( eq 13 ) is rapid , " allows the calculation of the relative ring - closure rate constants , kc,tlans / kc,cis. The product yields , [ (f)-trans-111 and [ (f)-cis-111 , and the relative rate ratios for ring closure of i to the racemized products , kc,uam / kc,a , are listed in Table I. Ring closure to the trans ketyl ( eq 11 ) is favored compared to closure to give cis ketyl and , as expected for an irreversible competitive process,'* the ratio of closure rates is lower at higher temperatures ( kc,trans / kc,cis = 25 f 1.6 , 61 " C ; 37 f 3 at 22 " C ) .	0

Organic products arising from facile cleavage of Si-C bonds of other (trialkylsily1)metal derivatives upon autoxidation have been previously observed and thus provide a precedent for the reactions described here. For example , treatment of the Grignard reagent Me3SiCH2MgC1 with 02 , followed by hydrolysis , gave significant quantities of Me3SiOH , (Me3Si)20 , and CH20.22 Therefore , these observations provide further evidence that such cleavage reactions may be a general feature of (trimethylsily1)- methyl derivatives upon autoxidation .	0

Dioxovanadium(V) also catalyzes the oxidation of iodide and chloride by H 2 0 2 in acid. Peroxovanadium(V) species oxidize iodide ; however , dioxovanadium(V) is reduced by iodide in acid,9 consistent with the observed decrease in the 51V NMR signal over time of the reaction solution under catalytic conditions ( data not shown ). Further , we have found that dioxovanadium(V) catalyzes the oxidation of chloride by hydrogen peroxide , and the formation of chlorotrimethoxybenzene ( Cl - TMB ; M+ m / e 202 , 204 ) , al- though the chlorination rate is slower than that for bromination. Thus we have shown that dioxovanadium(V) catalyzes the bromination of TMB and the bromide - assisted disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , analogous to the reactivity of the V-BrPO enzyme ( Scheme 11 ; in this scheme , HOBr , Br , and Br,- are in rapid equilibration ). In this biomimetic system , dioxovanadium(V) coordinates H202 forming the monoperoxo or diperoxo species , in ratios dependent on the hydrogen peroxide and acid concen- trations ( Figure 2 ). * The peroxovanadium(V) species then oxidize the halide , although the detailed mechanism of this reaction is not yet known : the halide could be oxidized directly by bound peroxide , retaining the vanadium(V) moiety , or the halide could coordinate or reduce vanadium(V) , before reduction of bound peroxide occurs. The two main differences between the biomimetic system and V-BrPO are the rate of catalysis and the pH depen- dence , with a much greater enzyme rate at higher pH. Further mechanistic studies are in progress to address the role of the protein in the enzymatic activity by investigating the role of oxo-	0
bands were assigned6 to the dipole - forbidden transition at 570 nm predictedsb for the triplet of la.

The ESR signal intensity was linear in 1 / T between 15 and 80 K. These observations led to the assignment of a triplet ground state for la.6 The formation of product 3 in the thermal ( 80 “ C ) reaction of ketone 2a in solution with fumaric ester was interpreted as chemical trapping of the biradical l a formed by loss of CO from 2a.6	0

At each potential within the C peak we observed a slow re- laxation of the current , as in LixTiS2,14 indicating a low diffusion coefficient characteristic of a solid state intercalation process. The absence of trailing current after the A , B , and C peaks proves that all the available sites have been occupied in the c60 solid at each of these reduction steps.1 ° J4 Furthermore , the noninteger values of 6x in waves A and B are also strong indications of truly solid state processes , in contrast to the integer electron steps associated with electroactivity of isolated molecules. The fifth wave at 0.8 V leads to x = 12. It is similar to a peak at about 0.6 V which we observe when performing lithium intercalation into graphite in such cells. Note that the Li : C ratio is about the same for Li12Cm and LE6 , the saturated value for the Li intercalated graphite compound which can be obtained in this way with the same polymer e1ectrolyte.I5	0

The treatment of squarate esters with 2 equiv of the same vinyl anion or 1 equiv each of two different vinyl anions has been discovered to trigger a cascade of chemical events that ultimately leads to polyquinane products.' Trans addition generates a cyclobutene dialkoxide which opens quickly to yield a doubly - charged 1,3,5,7-0ctatetraene amenable to cyclization from its coiled conformation. Both events proceed conrotatorily , and information about structural effects on reactivity has begun to emerge.* In unsymmetrical cases , the resultant 1,3,5- cyclooctatrienes do not necessarily experience monoprotonation at both available enolate centers regioselectively. As a conse- quence , competing aldolization can give rise to a pair of polyquinanes. Site - selective protonation is achieved when one of the anions is acetylenic in nature.3 Described herein is a more flexible and utilitarian means for achieving regioselectivity based upon kinetically controlled / . ? -elimination.

Structure Elucidation of IW77 ( 3 ). RM77 ( 3 ) precipitated as a yellow powder from HPLC fractions. Sodium [1,2-13C2]- acetate feeding experiments indicate that RM77 ( 3 ) is derived from an octaketide ( eight acetate units ) backbone. The I3C- NMR spectrum contains chemical shifts indicative of a quinone moiety , as well as characteristic peaks associated with 2-hy- droxy-4-pyrone rings formed at the carboxyl end of several p o l y k e t i d e ~ . ~ - ~ ~ ~ ~ Unambiguous ' H- and I3C - NMR chemical shift assignments for RM77 were confirmed via heteronuclear multiple bond correlation ( HMBC ) studies and I3C coupling constants obtained with an isotopically labeled sample ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ). Also , consistent with the proposed structure was the absence of any significant nuclear Overhauser effect ( NOE ) interaction. High - resolution fast atom bombardment ( FAB ) mass spectroscopy gave molecular weights of 337.0324 ( M + Na+ , 337.0319 expected ) and 315 ( M + H+ ) consistent with the molecular formula C16H1007 .	0
the positive control pWHM732 hearing fcmlKLMN that pro- duced 2 exclusively. Taken together , these results show that a heterologous pair of P-ketoacy1:acyl carrier protein synthase1 chain length factor proteins can he nonfunctional , as evident in the combinations of acfl - ORFl / fcmL that failed either to complement the mutation in WMH1061 & e. , to restore Tcm C synthesis ) or to synthesize any metabolite in WMH1077. However , the chain length factor seems to have a relaxed fidelity because the combination of fcmWact1 - ORF2 was able to complement WMH1068 , albeit less effectively than fcmWfcmL on the basis of the relative yields of 1. Since the Act polyketide synthase specifies an octaketide intermediate , the fact that fcmW acfl - ORF2 restored the production of 1 to WMH1068 , via a decaketide intermediate , strongly suggests that the chain length factor alone is not sufficient to control the chain length. In fact , populations of both C I ~ and C ~ O metabolites were identified as 2 and 5 in the case of the WMH1077 transfonnant carrying tcmliVacfl - ORF2 / fcmMN. These results differ from the he- havior of the chain length factor encoding genes reported by Sherman , Hopwood , and co-worker ~ ’ ~ where only the gral- ORF2 gene ( encoding a protein functionally identical to Act- Otfl ) among the three tested was capable of restoring actinor- hodin production to an acfl - ORFZ mutant hut are consistent with the report of McDonald et aI.* ’ that the tcmL gene in combination with actl - ORFI did not produce a functional polyketide synthase .	0

The additional ring which arises from an intramolecular HDA reaction may be useful for the synthesis of triquinanes or other polycyclic compounds. The decrease in entropy associated with tethering the two reactive components suggests that the reaction would be significantly more facile than the intermolecular reaction.25 However , this potential rate enhancement is com- promised by the dramatic decrease in rate associated with intermolecular cycloadditions with substituted norbomadienes as described previously. There were no reported examples of successful intramolecular HDA reactions in the literature prior to 1992.5d,26 In an intramolecular reaction , there are two possible modes of [ 2n + 227 + 2271 cycloaddition which have to be considered ( Scheme 3 ). The dienophile in the tether can cyclize on Ca- Cb-CC to give a cycloadduct of type I or it can cyclize on Cd- Ce-Cf to give a type I1 cycloadduct. Molecular models and MM2 calculations indicate that both products would be stable .	0
Crystal Structure of Mixed Valent Bromides. Crystals of [4][Br] belong to the monoclinic space group C2 / c ; a summary of pertinent intra- and intermolecular distances is provided in Table 2. The crystal structure consists of ribbon - like arrays of alternating [4]’+ radical cations and bromide anions strung together along two-fold axes running parallel to the y direction ; these ribbons form in-register layers in the xy plane , as shown in Figure 4. The ribbons are layered in the z direction , each layer being offset from the one above and below so that the halide ion of one layer is approximately aligned with the internal S-S bond of one of the CN & rings in the layers above and below it. This packing arrangement , which is similar to that ( 2 1 ) Cordes , A. W. ; Goddard , J. D. ; Oakley , R. T. ; Westwood , N. P. C. ( 22 ) Shannon , R. D. Acta Crystallogr. 1976 , A32 , 751 .	0

We have previously shown orthogonal self - assembly ( OSA ) for two other systems : ( I ) Au and A1203 microstructures exposed to a solution of substituted thiols and carboxylic acids , “ and ( 2 ) plasma - treated Au and F’t surfaces exposed to a solution of substituted disulfides and isonitriles.lb As will be clarified below , the first system suffers from the disadvantage that one of the materials , A1203 , is not electrically conductive. The second system unfortunately involves exposure of Au and F’t surfaces to non-equimolar solutions of the disulfide and isoni- trile. The significance of our new results presented here is that we have found two systems by which the OSA process in Scheme 1 can be achieved from an equimolar solutiou of reagents LI and L2 using two electrically conductive materials , Au and ITO , as substrates .	0

Department of Chemistry and Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter , University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6323 Received March 27 , I995 A common goal in sensory materials is increased sensitivity , which has led to great interest in fluorescence - based chemosen- sors.' However , in spite of progress in instrumentation and materials , there is an ever increasing need for the detection of trace analytes. Increasing the association constant of the recognition ( binding ) event increases a sensory device 's sen- sitivity. Unfortunately , such an approach to enhanced sensitivity can have the disadvantage of irreversible responses or very long reset times. An additional limitation is that receptors with sufficiently high association constants may not be available. In this report we demonstrate a new method for enhancing the sensitivity of a fluorescence - based chemosensor , which may be used in conjunction with , but does not require , an increased association constant. This method makes use of the special electronic properties of conjugated polymers , which results in an amplified response due to the efficient energy migration to occupied receptor sites .	0

Electron probe microanalysis indicated the presence of Cu , Ge , and S in a 1 : 2 : 5 molar ratio. Chemical analysis for the elements S , C , N , and H gave weight percentages of 32.56 , 20.17 , 2.70 , and 3.72 , respectively ; these values are consistent with those expected from the following crystal structure deter- mination ( 32.12 , 19.25,2.80 , and 4.01 wt % ). The IR spectrum between 4000 and 625 cm-' contains only the characteristic features attributable to the TEA+ ion.6 This spectrum was recorded from 4000 to 400 cm-l on a Perkin - Elmer 1600 Series FTJR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. Another absorption peak , at 430 cm-I , could not be unambiguously assigned because of the distribution of both Ge-S and Cu-S vibration modes around 400 ~ m - ' . ' , ~ Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) was carried out using a Perkin - Elmer thermal analysis system. A 1.8 mg sample was heated in air at the rate of 2.0 " C / min from room temperature to 400 " C. Two distinct steps of weight loss were observed : a 13.3 % loss from 250 to 290 " C and a further 16.7 % decrease in weight between 290 to 360 " C .	0

Overall , this report demonstrates a way to increase the strength of binding between zeolite crystals and the substrates , which allows assembly of strongly bound zeolite monolayers even on curved glass surfaces ( fibers ). This method may be especially useful to fabricate optical fibers coated with zeolite crystals in high coverage for the photochemical application recently intro- duced by Raftery et al.18	0

As part of a project to elucidate the relationship between protein structure and the control of peroxidase vs peroxygenase function , we have expressed HRP in a baculovirus / insect cell system29 and recently reported in a preliminary communication that the F41L and F41T mutants of HRP catalyze the sulfoxi- dation of thioanisoles at higher rates and , in the case of F41L , with higher stereospecificity than the native protein.30 Sulfoxi- dation , however , is not a strong indicator of peroxygenase activity because the reaction is catalyzed by all known peroxi- dases. We provide here additional information on the sulfoxi- dation of thioethers by the F41L and F41T mutants and , more importantly , report that the same two mutations endow HRP with the ability to epoxidize styrene , a reaction that is not generally catalyzed by classical peroxidases .	0

Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of a. Dithionite - reduced a exhibited relatively strong EPR features between g = 6 and 3 , and a weak gav = 1.94 - type signal ( g = 2.04 , 1.93 , 1.86 ) , quantifying to only 0.1 spida ( Figure 2A ). The low - field features have shapes and g-values similar to , but not the same as , those from native enzyme ( Figure 2B ). These features suggest that the [ Fe4S4l1+ cluster in a has an S = % , S = l / 2 spin - state mixture. The best - characterized cluster exhibiting such a spin - state mixture is in the Fe protein of nitrogenase. At 10 " C , 40 % of the nitrogenase Fe protein clusters are S = l / 2 and yield ga , = 1.94 EPR signals ; the remainder are S = 3 / 2 and yield features between g = 6 and 4.44,45 The proportion of each spin - state varies depending on the solvent. a-[Fe & ]'+	0
Abstract : The reaction of a series of allyl-substituted bis(phenylsulfony1)methanes or dimethyl malonates with 2,3- bis(phenylsulfony1)- 1,3-butadiene in the presence of base afforded alkenyl-substituted allenes in good yield. The reaction proceeds by initial attack of the soft carbanion onto the terminal position of the diene , and this is followed by PhSO2- elimination to give the phenylsulfonyl-substituted allene. Themal[2 + 21-cycloaddition proceeded across the C I - C ~ double bond of the allene with completely sterospecificity. Stepwise bonding prefers to occur in a 1,6- ex0 manner rather than in a 1,7-endo fashion. Substitution at the 7-position of the x-bond causes a crossover in the regioselectivity of the [ 2 + 21-cycloaddition process. All products can be rationalized by a mechanism which includes an initial carbon-carbon bond formation involving the central allene carbon to give a diradical intermediate. The product distribution is then determined by the substitution pattem of the alkene and the fate of the diradical intermediate .	0

Abstract : The previously observed preferential syn delivery of hydride anion in the reduction of the carbonyl group of 5-fluoroadamantan-2-one is inverted if the identities of all hydrogen and fluorine atoms are reversed. A similar and somewhat smaller alteration is observed in the reduction of 5-chloroperfluoroadamantan-2-one. The interpretation is that the periplanar bonds are then no longer capable of stabilizing the transition state by electron donation , and instead do so by accepting electron density from the incipient bond into the u* orbitals. The configurations of the reduction products were deduced from their I9F NMR spectra by means of a chemical shift additivity procedure .	0

Three monomer compositions were polymerized under two sets of solvent conditions ( Table 1 ) : EGDM homopolymers were prepared as nonimprinted polymers , P1 and P2. Cholesterol- imprinted polymers P3 and P4 were the products of the copolymerization of cholesteryl (4-viny1)phenyl carbonate ( 1 ) and EGDM. Similarly the phenol - imprinted polymers P5 and P6 were synthesized from phenyl (4-viny1)phenyl carbonate ( 2 ) and EGDM. The polymers were all prepared “ in bulk ” by ther- mally - initiated free radical polymerization , using an azo-initiator. Solvents used in the above polymer preparations gave macro- porous polymers of low to moderate surface area ( Table 1 ). Polymers , as prepared , contain the template molecule co- valently attached to the polymer matrix , requiring hydrolysis of the carbonate ester group to remove the template and generate the recognition sites. The loss of the carbonyl group ( as Cor ) during hydrolysis of the carbonate ester provides sufficient space to allow the template- and vinylphenol - derived hydroxyl groups to form a hydrogen bond in the rebindinghecognition event ( Scheme la ). The polymers P1-P6 were hydqolyzed to form PlH-P6H , respectively .	0

Abstract : The photophysics of ~ ac-(dppz)Re1(CO)s(4-MePy)][C1] ( 1 , where dppz = dipyrido[3,2-a:2’,3’-c]phenazine and 4-MePy = 4-methylpyridine ) have been examined in organic solvents and in aqueous solution with and without calf thymus DNA. Emission and nanosecond to microsecond transient absorption studies of 1 in organic solvents such as MeOH , MeCN , and CH2Cl2 indicate that the lowest excited state of the complex is a dppz - based intraligand triplet state ( 31Ldppz ). The 31Ldppz state is characterized by weak room temperature phosphorescence and a strong TO = 470 nm. Absorption and emission studies of 1 in aqueous solution with added DNA indicate that the complex binds to the biopolymer , persumably by intercalation of the dppz ligand. Complex 1 is non-luminescent in aqueous solution ; however , 31Ldppz phosphorescence is observed from the DNA - bound form of the complex in aqueous solution. The 31Ldppz assignment for the emission from the DNA - bound complex is	0
for both waves , by the peak separation ( Up ) and the ratio of the anodic to cathodic peak current ( ipalipc ). The Up values are 0.060 V , and no variation with the scan rate is observed. A plot of ipa against the square root of the scan speed is linear across a range of 0.050 - 0.500 V s-l ( correlation coefficient > 0.99 ) , as expected for a diffusion - controlled electrode process , and the measurement of the ratio iP & = 1 for the two waves showed the chemical reversibility of the two one - electron transfers. The data for peak potentials and current peak ratio are compiled in Table 1. The comparison of these potentials with that of the corresponding monomer 3 demonstrates the electron - donor effect of the second iron center reducing the first oxidation potential by 0.55 V. The role of the electron- donating-C4 - bridge is also illustrated by comparison of the oxidation potential of the monocation 5+ and the monomer 3 ; it is large enough to balance the electron - withdrawing effect of the positive charge .	0

Many studies have examined the oxidation of toluene and related alkyl aromatics by CrO2- C12 ( and chromic acid in various form^ ). ^ A variety of mechanisms have been suggested , including radical ( chain and nonchain ) pathways , carbocation routes , and concerted mech- anisms. The nature of the chromium product has also been much discussed. A charge - transfer complex is observed in reactions of CrO2C12 with a r e n e ~ , ~ ~ . ~ ' but the extent of complex formation and its possible effect on the oxidation mechanism have not been addressed. Only approximate kinetic parameters and isotope effects are and a mass balance for the reaction has not been reported. In sum , a clear picture of the oxidation of toluene by CrO2C12 has not emerged.

The former reaction obeys the rate law v = k[Sm]’[olefin]O[PhSiH3]’. D20 quenching of the reaction yields PhCD(CH3)(CH2CH3) and PhSiH2D as mechanistically informative products. The hydrosilylation of 1,5-hexadiene effected by Cp’2SmCH(SiMe3)2 affords predominantly cyclopentylCH2SiH2Ph , while Me2SiCp ” zSmCH- (SiMe3)2 and (R)-MezSiCp ” [ ( -)-menthylCp]SmCH(SiMe3)2 also yield hydrosilylation products derived from 1,5- hexadiene skeletal rearrangement. The hydrosilylation mechanism is discussed in terms of a hydride / alkyl cycle involving rapid , exothermic olefin insertion into an Ln-H bond followed by turnover - limiting Si-WLn-alkyl transposition ( delivery of the alkyl group to Si ) .	0
Abstract : The geometry and electronic structure of 0-methyl methylphosphonofluoridate ( 1 ) ( MeOPOFMe ) have been determined at the MP2 / 6-31G(D) and Becke3LYP / 6-31G(D) levels. The calculations confirm the prior results of lower - level ab initio calculations which indicated that the experimental gas phase electron diffraction structure of 1 is substantially in error. The compound exists in a single conformation determined by the operation of an anomeric effect between the methoxy oxygen atom and the P-F bond as is evident from the nearly perpendicular orientation of the 0-C and P-F bonds. A reanalysis of the published gas electron diffraction ( GED ) data yielded inconclusive results but underscored the inability of GED to distinguish between the conformations of 1. 'H and I3C NMR spectra are reported and are consistent with the existence of a single conformer. The lower excited singlet states of 1 are calculated to be Rydberg states originating from excitations from the p - type nonbonding orbitals of the monocoordinated oxygen atom into diffuse 3s- and 3p - type orbitals. The transitions are predicted to occur in the vacuum W and have low oscillator strength. The Fist two transitions have moderate positive rotatory strength for the ( R ) enantiomer , leading to the prediction of absolute configuration , (+)-(R)-1 .	0
In order to explore these effects more thoroughly , we have designed a new class of porphyrin - quinone dyads that feature both rigid , nonconjugated hydrocarbon bridges between the donor and acceptor and relatively strong electronic coupling between these moieties and , therefore , might be expected to display enhanced electron transfer rates in viscous , nonpolar media and at low temperatures. Herein we report the synthesis and spectroscopic study of the first of these molecules , dyads 1-3 , in which the porphyrin electron donor and quinone acceptor are joined by short bicyclic bridges .	0

With an eye to developing general methodology to ynediene natural product^,^ we explored the addition of l a outlined in eq 1 as a route to butenolide 4a. Exposing the two reactants to 2 mol % palladium acetate and 2 mol % tris(2,6-dimeth- oxyphenyl)phosphineE(TDMPP) in THF did indeed produce 4a9 but also a second product readily identified as furan 5a9 by its spectroscopic properties. To explore what role , if any , the presence of a hydroxyl group in the donor alkyne played in facilitating furan formation and to determine the parameters to promote furan formation , we tumed to a simpler system , l b ( eq 1 ). Most revealing was the effect of the ratio of ligand to palladium salt on this process. In this case , lactonization of the initial adduct 2b to 4b appears to be quite slow and the preferred cyclization path produces the furan 5b. Treatment under the above conditions gives mostly the initial adduct as well as furan. Performing the reaction in benzene saw more conversion of the initial adduct 2b to a mixture of isofuran 3bI0 and furan 5b. To establish whether the rather basic phosphine TDMPP was promoting furan formation , its ratio relative to palladium acetate was increased. However , the net effect was a strong inhibition of cyclization of 2b. Quite the contrary , increasing the amount of palladium acetate relative to TDMPP dramatically improved the furan formation. Thus , using a 1 : 2 or preferably 2 : s TDMPP : Pd(OAc)z ratio effects complete addition and cyclization to 3b and 5b. The tautomerization of the isofuran is completed upon addition of DBU at this point. These results implicate unligated palladium acetate as the preferred catalyst for the cyclization of the initial adduct .	0

Box 12194 Research Triangle Park , North Carolina 27709 Received November 21 , 1994 Catalytic antibodies have been produced for more than 50 reactions involving conversion of either macromolecular or simple chemical substrates to products.I The majority of these reactions are either unimolecular or ester hydrolysis reactions , and the number of antibodies which catalyze reactions resulting in formation of carbon-carbon bonds is relatively smalL2 Bond formation between carbon atoms is a keystone of synthetic organic chemistry , and the Michael addition of weak acids to electron - deficient double bonds is among the most useful of such reaction^.^ We describe here the production and initial characterization of an antibody which catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen cyanide with an unsaturated ketone substrate. It is the first report , to our knowledge , of an antibody which catalyzes bimolecular carbon-carbon bond formation by 1 ,Caddition to a simple activated olefin : and the transition state analog ( TSA ) strategy used may be extended to other Michael - type reactions. The 1 ,Caddition of hydrogen cyanide to a $ -unsaturated ketones was studied by Agami et al.,5 who concluded from the kinetics of the reaction and from the Hammett effect of aromatic substituents that the reaction proceeds along the pathway shown in Figure 1. The transition state was postulated to resemble the enolate structure ( 3 , 4 ) , and the pH dependence of the reaction demonstrated that the cyanide ion was the likely reactant .	0

In summary , electrochemical oxidation of 1 leads to spon- taneous incorporation of a third oxide to yield 2 with an unusual [Mu03(ri-MeC02)] core. Treatment with a F- source yields 4 , the initial example of a F -- containing Mn / O / RCO ? aggregate and one that can be considered a potential model of F -- inhibited WOC. Its ready formation and the minimal structural perturba- tion by the F- of the host Mn / O core are of interest vis-h-vis the similarly ready F- incorporation into the WOC Mn / O / RCO ? cluster , whose precise structure has yet to be defined ; note , however , that the [ Ma031 partial cubane is one of the structural units consistent with EXAFS data on the W 0 C i 6 The present work suggests that F- in the WOC could enter a pr mode by displacing a pr - RCO ? - group and / or occupying a site that would normally be occupied by a pr-02- or -OH- group derived from substrate H20. Work in progress is directed toward more fully characterizing the influence of F- on the properties of the MQO ~ host , including the redox potentials of further oxidations , and incorporating other groups into the vacancy of the partial cubane unit .	0

As far as the coupling partners are concerned , imines impart more advantages to this reaction as regards the selectivity and asymmetric synthesis ( Scheme 3 ). The acetylene complex 11 reacted with an achiral imine 21 to afford an allenylamine 22 virtually as a single isomer.10 This is in marked contrast to the aforementioned aldehyde addition , which usually gave rise to the formation of a mixture of two isomeric alcohols. The structure assigned to 22 was verified by the comparison with authentic samples.8 It should be noted that the relative stereochemistry of the allene moiety and the methyl group in 22 is different from that of the corresponding aldehyde adduct 13 obtained from the same E-enyne ( Scheme 1 ) , suggesting a different stereochemical approach between aldehydes and imines to the enyne - titanium complex.

As far as the coupling partners are concerned , imines impart more advantages to this reaction as regards the selectivity and asymmetric synthesis ( Scheme 3 ). The acetylene complex 11 reacted with an achiral imine 21 to afford an allenylamine 22 virtually as a single isomer.10 This is in marked contrast to the aforementioned aldehyde addition , which usually gave rise to the formation of a mixture of two isomeric alcohols. The structure assigned to 22 was verified by the comparison with authentic samples.8 It should be noted that the relative stereochemistry of the allene moiety and the methyl group in 22 is different from that of the corresponding aldehyde adduct 13 obtained from the same E-enyne ( Scheme 1 ) , suggesting a different stereochemical approach between aldehydes and imines to the enyne - titanium complex.

The last two entries ( f and g ) address the feasibility of applying this reaction sequence to complex natural product synthesis. Bicyclization of the imide aniodiodonium salt derived from readily available tosylurea 4f leads to a tricyclic product 10 structurally related to the novel marine alkaloid agelastatin A. In addition , the acetal 4g can be processed similarly to the diene 11 which embodies three out of the four central rings of the cephalotaxine family of anticancer alkaloids. In summary , the tandem nucleophile additiodcarbene insertion sequence characteristic of alkynyliodonium salts can be extended to intramolecularly disposed nitrogen containing nucleophiles. Base induced bicyclization of the alkynyliodoniudtosylamide substrates leads to a rapid increase in molecular complexity and provides efficient access to a variety of cyclopentylamine- containing alkaloid skeleta .	0

In this paper , we describe a novel and direct approach for chiral recognition of chiral crown ethers toward amino acid ester ammonium ion guests. The hosts and guests studied are shown in Charts 1 and 2 , respectively. First , it has been described that both the degree and the direction of chiral recognition can be directly , easily , and reliably determined using FAB mass spectrometry , which is coupled with an enantiomer - labeled guest ( EL ) method.28 Second , it has also been described that the results obtained by the present methodology are reasonably correlated with the thermodynamic relative stabilities for the corresponding host - guest complexation equilibria in solution.

We report here , however , that small single - stranded circular oligonucleotides can serve as efficient templates for initiation and elongation of RNA sequences and that this occurs in the absence of added RNA primers , in the absence of RNA promoter sequences , and in the absence of any duplex structure at all. The synthetic circular DNAs are considerably smaller than the enzyme itself , yet they serve as highly efficient templates for the production of repeating RNA sequences thousands of nucleotides in length .	0
These observations are consistent with the mechanism outlined in Scheme 2. The presence of ketene methide 8 under laser - jet conditions was supported by the isolation of ester 9 , in low yield ( -5-6 % ) , from the high - intensity reaction in PhWMeOH ( 40 : 60 ). ' Apparently 8 either does not accumulate under these conditions , but rapidly reacts by one of the thermal or photochemical pathways shown in Scheme 2 , or is relatively unreactive toward methanol.8	0
The rearrangement of deuterium atoms in labeled alkylmetal hydrides has also been explained in terms of alkane complex intermediates ( path I , Figure l ). 234,5,15 However , an alternative explanation for the scrambling of isotopic labels in these alkylmetal hydride complexes is the direct dyotropic rearrange- ment over the transition state pictured in path 2 of Figure I. In an attempt to clarify the mechanism involved in these deuterium- scrambling reactions we have carried out kinetic investigations of the interconversion of diastereomeric (hydrido)(dimethylcy- clopropy1)iridium complexes l a and l b and the deuterium scrambling of their a-deuterio analogs. Previous work in our lab ~ ratories ' ~ examined the chemistry of the rhodium analogs of la,b ; however , the thermal instability of the rhodium complexes precluded the isolation and stereochemical charac- terization of diastereomerically pure materials. A dramatic difference in behavior of the Rh and Ir systems yields significant conclusions regarding the reaction coordinate for alkane oxida- tive addition reactions to metal centers .	0

present systems ) orbital symmetry selection rules are actually fully obeyed. Thus , the ultimate formation of a mixture of diene geometric isomers can be understood in terms of a mechanism in which ring opening occurs in stereospecific , disrotatory fashion on the excited state surface to yield a single , electroni- cally excited diene. The overall non-stereoselectivity results from the manner in which the excited product decays to the ground state , primarily by E,Z - isomerization. In conventional terms , our results suggest that ring opening follows the excited state pathway predicted by orbital symmetry rules , but the avoided crossing for disrotatory cyclobutenelbutadiene inter- conver ~ ion ~ , ~ is bypassed to allow access to the same region of the excited state potential energy surface that is accessed predominantly when the single diene isomer is itself excited directly. Similar behavior is observed for a series of bicyclo- [n.2.0]alk-l-enes related to cis-4 , whose isomeric 1,3-dienes are structurally locked in the s-cis conformation.22	0

X-ray Crystallographic Analysis of (S)-1a and (R)-1a. Colorless rectangular - shaped single crystals of (S)-1a were obtained from a mixed solution of hexane and chloroform. The crystal structure was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ). An (S)-1a single crystal adopted an orthorhombic chiral space group P212121. The structure was determined by direct methods and successive Fourier synthesis.

Synthesis. Whereas the synthesis of the peptide Ac- (NPNA)3-OH could be carried out using standard solid - phase peptide synthetic methods , with the Fmoc chemistry,20 attempts to construct the methylated peptide Ac-(NPMeNA)3-OH in the same way gave a complex mixture of peptides , due to difficulties in coupling efficiently onto PMe. Steric hindrance slowed the acylation of PMe on the solid phase , as well as in free solution , using HBTU21,22 or PyBroPZ3 activation , and was incomplete even with prolonged coupling times. For this reason the PMe- containing peptides used for later studies were prepared in solution by the route shown in Scheme 1. The corresponding C - terminal methyl esters were prepared by treatment of the free acids with diazomethane .	0

Received January 30 , 1995 (32)- and (3E)-Dactomelynes ( 1 and 2 , Scheme 1 ) were isolated from the digestive glands of the sea hare Aplysia dactylomela by Schmitz and co-workers. ' Together with elatenyne,* isolated from a sample of Luurencia ehta , they represent a group of nonisoprenoid ethers which are character- ized by a unique pyranopyranyl skeleton with ethyl and pentenynyl substituents. The most characteristic feature in their structures is the presence of strategically located halogen atoms on the tetrahydropyran rings. The chlorine substituent is oriented on the sterically hindered side , whereas the bromine substituent avoids steric congestion. Stereoselective introduction of the halogen atoms in the ring systems is difficult , and the lack of general synthetic methods for stereoselective halide preparation is amply manifested in an unsuccessful attempt for the synthesis of dactomelynes by Kozik ~ wski. ~	0

One immediately evident solution to this problem was to utilize a tethering substituent that would temporarily connect the two reactive groups and be subsequently r e m ~ v e d . ~ Al- though meritorious , this approach would entail the addition of minimally two steps to a synthetic sequence in attaching and removing the tethering group. An alternative approach is suggested in Scheme 1. Utilization of an azido alcohol such as 2-azidoethanol ( 1 ) presents an activated ketone with two potential nucleophiles. Our previous work has shown that direct attack by azide is possible but only marginally effective. Instead , hemiketal formation could occur , followed by dehydra- tion to generate the oxonium ion shown. At this point , intramolecular attack of the azide on the carbocation is possible , following our own precedent2 and that of Pearson and co- workers.6 Migration of one of the alkyl groups with concomi- tant loss of NZ would then afford an iminium ether species that , upon addition of water , would give the formal product of direct insertion of the azide end of 1 into the ketone .	0
anticipated to be highly delocalized along the a-bonded backbones. The primary importance of the present analysis , however , is that the apparent ability of the Sandorfy HMO approximation to successfully model the electronic structures of long - chain polystannanes in a qualitative fashion implies that other recent additions and refinements to this theory as it applies to hydrocarbons and polysilanes can be extrapolated with some degree of confidence to include the heaviest group 14 poly- metallanes as well. This , in turn , should prove crucial for helping to elucidate , at the next level of investigation , the role of various types of substituents ( e.g. , alkyl vs aryl ) in defining the properties of different families of polystannane oligomers that are potentially accessible through the straightforward route shown in Scheme 1. Studies along these lines are now in progress .	0
In the soft - glass regime , the solvent molecular motion is not frozen and is sufficient to allow ET to O C C U ~ . ~ Thus , while the forward ET reaction seems to be independent of the LC phase ( solid and fluid ) , the secondary ET becomes active only in the soft - glass and in the fluid nematic phases. The disappearance of the triplet spectrum , which occurs with the RP signal phase inversion , is probably due to a high quantum yield of the secondary ( back ) reaction , making A-B-3*C short - lived .	0
donor molecule to one of the disproportionation products , RhIII(por ). 7a In contrast , Saveant et al. more recently suggested21a that disproportionation is due to the deligation of the original RhII(por)Lx adduct.

Abstract : This paper presents a strategy to tune the orientation of immobilized proteins on electrodes of general applicability to different types of proteins. We orient ferredoxin : NADP+ reductase molecules onto a modified gold electrode by introducing a genetically engineered metal binding site on a selected region of the protein surface and covering the gold surface with a self - assembled monolayer of thiols appended with nitrilotriacetic acid groups complexed with metal transition ions. Two mutants were designed to have a histidine pair ( His- X3 - His ) on surface - exposed R-helices located in one of the two protein domains. It was first demonstrated that the mutant proteins in solution retain their full activity and that the kinetic constants of the redox catalytic steps are not affected by the mutations. The enzyme - modified gold electrodes were then analyzed for the amount and distribution of protein on their surface and for their activity using atomic force microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The two electrode - bound mutant enzymes manifested differences in the amount and distribution of bound molecules , in the kinetic constants of their redox catalytic steps , and most interestingly , in their ability to transfer electrons to a redox mediator covalently attached to the self - assembled monolayer. We conclude that the position of the mutated R-helix determined the orientation of the protein with respect to the surface and , as a result , its competence to establish direct electrical communication with the electrode .	0

Abstract : A novel modular design is presented for the introduction of biotinylated photoprobes containing either 4-azidotetrafluorobenzamide , 4-( 1 -azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzamide , or 4-benzoylbenzoylamide. The use of bioti- nylated affinity labels offers several advantages over radiolabeled probes by virtue of their exploitation of the biotin- avidin system of detection and purification. A biotinylated benzoylbenzoyl photoprobe of pepstatin ( BBB - pepstatin , 5 ) was synthesized in three steps from pepstatin. The photoprobe is a competitive inhibitor of porcine pepsin , with an apparent dissociation constant of 3 1 pM. Westem blotting of BBB-pepstatin-photolabeled porcine pepsin , renin , cathepsin D and human renin , and cathepsin D could be detected with an avidin - horseradish peroxidase label. Routinely , 7 pM of aspartic protease could be photolabeled and detected with this system. The pepstatin photoaffinity probe is also very selective ; the probe failed to label cysteine protease ( papain ) , metalloprotease ( carboxypepitase A ) , and serine protease ( chymotrypsin and trypsin ). To further establish the utility of the biotinylated probe , BBB- pepstatin - photolabeled porcine pepsin was purified by monomeric avidin chromatography. This probe should be useful for the identification of unknown cytosolic and membrane - bound aspartic proteases .	0
It should be borne in mind , however , that the original report of CLMy 1' cleavages of bacterial DNA noted that sequences other than TCCT - AGGA were identified by the natural product as well,' an important finding that was amplified by subsequent work. Most telling among these studies was the observation of comparable extents of cleavage at runs of thymines four or greater in In particular , these sequences lack the exocyclic 2-amino group of a GC base pair and argue for the general case that aryl iodide interactions with this function can not be the primary reason for site selectivity of CLM - induced cleavage. Nonetheless , footprinting studies of synthetic samples of the aryl-linked carbohydrate side chain containing an iodine substituent or replacing it by , for example , hydrogen suggest that the presence of the large halogen atom contributes to the DNA binding selectivity seen in these experiments and , therefore , of CLM.8-fo Similarly , NMR studies of CLMyl ' with an ACCTnTGGA sequence incorporated into an octomer duplex show that the aryl iodide could contact the 3'-guanine but not the 5'-guanine.

The absorption ( Figure 2B , inset ) is due to the carbostyril 124 attached via an amide linkage to the chelate.

Carbostyril bound to chelate could easily be distinguished from free carbostyril since the absorption spectra of free carbostyril ( data not shown ) has a maximum at 342 with a shoulder at 330 nm.

Abstract : The methylmetal hydride compounds of zinc , cadmium , and mercury have been formed by the insertion of the excited metal atom into methane and trapped in an argon matrix. The excitation of the zinc , cadmium , or mercury atom required to promote insertion can be effected through the use of a heated microwave discharge source of the metal by the action of its resonance radiation or by irradiation into the 3 P ~ metal excited state. The methylmetal hydride compounds have been characterized by infrared spectroscopy and their identities authenticated by *H and I3C enrichment. The mechanism of insertion has been investigated by selective photolysis studies of the matrix- isolated reactants. The insertion product formed by the reaction of excited mercury atoms with ethane has also been studied .	0

Abstract : The unimolecular decompositions of 5-methylheptanenitrile ( l ) , 6-methyloctanenitrile ( 2 ) , and 7-methyl- nonanenitrile ( 3 ) complexed to bare Co ’ cations have been investigated by means of tandem mass spectrometry. Extensive regio- and diastereospecific labeling experiments were conducted to gain further insight into the mechanistic details , in particular the stereoselectivity of the Co+ - induced demethanation in the gas phase. The overall reaction follows a 1,2-elimination mode , and , with regard to the regiospecificity , the neutral methane originates exclusively from the ( w-2 ) and ( 0-1 ) positions of the alkyl chain. For 2 and 3 the examination of diastereospecifically labeled isotopomers reveals that the gas - phase demethanation exhibits a remarkable diastereoselectivity. This unprecedented example for a stereoselective C-C bond activation in gas - phase organometallic chemistry can be accounted for in terms of steric features of the metallacyclic intermediates .	0

The previously unknown 8 was derived from propargyl alcohol 10 as depicted on Scheme 1. Thus , as described for the preparation of 7,'4b zirconium- catalyzed methylalumination of 10 afforded alkenyl iodide 11 in 60 % yield. Sonogashira - type coupling of 11 with trimeth- ylsilylacetylene under the modified conditions described by Lin ~ trumelle ' ~ ( CuYpyrrolidine , 91 % yield ) , followed by depro- tection of the so formed 12 ( 93 % yield ) , led to enynol 13.

These compounds represent a new class of metalloporphyrins : they are simultaneously extremely electron - deficient and non- planar , and they contain no substituent groups capable of n-interaction with the ring. They are therefore excellent compounds to probe the electronic consequences of porphyrin ring distortions in the absence of conjugation effects. Here we report the structure and properties of [ tetrakis(heptafluoropro- pyl)porphinato]cobalt(II) 1. Examination of the spectroscopic properties of 1 and of the free base , 2 , in conjunction with theoretical studies , indicates that nonplanar conformations have an extremely modest effect on the electronic properties of these ligands .	0
What is the cause ( or what are the causes ) of this huge difference in reactivity ? A large part of it pertains to nuclear reorganization insofar as the bridgehead unconjugated sp3 radical formed upon cleavage of la'- is certainly less stable than the conjugated 4-nitrobenzyl radical. The same factor has been shown to be responsible for the fact that bridgehead halides in the adamantane , bicyclooctane , and bicyclopentane series have reduction potentials significantly more negative than analogous halides giving rise to sp2 radicals in dissociative electron transfer reactions where the activation energy is mostly govemed by the magnitude of the homolytic bond dissociation energy.4f In more quantitative terms , the activation free energy for anion radical cleavage may be obtained through the following equa- t i o n ~ : ~	0

National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research Tsukuba , Ibaraki 305 , Japan Received April 5 , 1995 Transition - metal - catalyzed reaction of hydrosilanes or disi- lanes is one of the most useful methods to prepare monomeric and polymeric organosilicon compounds that are experiencing vigorous growth. I Platinum complexes in particular provide excellent catalysts for the transformation of hydrosilanes and disilanes. Mono- and bis(silyl)platinum(II) complexes are usually believed to play important roles in hydrosilylation , e dehydrocoupling , and double silylation reactions with hydro- silanes and d i ~ i l a n e s . ~ - ~ However , as several groups have demonstrated , mechanistic details appear much more compli- cated , depending on the structures of these compound^.^ Here we report two unusual complexes being formed in the reaction of 1,2-disilylbenzene (1)6 and platinum(0) complexes ; one is a tetrakis(silyl)platinum(IV) complex , the first example of a tetrakis(sily1) transition - metal species , and the other is a dinuclear , mixed - valence complex containing a Pt " Pt " Si2 ring system .	0

Previous work in our group was directed toward the self- assembly of small aggregates ( dimers ) and coordination poly- mers using the uranyl ~ a t i o n . ~ In this communication we show the first example of spheres of well - defined dimensions with a narrow size distribution formed completely by self - assembly,I0 i.e. , without the need of repeated chemical reactions. Our ap- proach employs the combination of a kinetically inert tridentate ligand and kinetically labile cyano groups in a square planar Pd(I1) complex. The self - assembly process is based on the substitution of the labile acetonitrile molecules for cyanomethyl groups of the tridentate ligand thereby adding a new building block , as is schematically depicted in Scheme 1. The branching in the repeating units leads to a metallodendritic structure .	0
Abstract : We have prepared a novel series of banana - shaped molecules with a central bent core based on a 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene group , the side wings containing a Schiff ’s based moiety , and alkoxy flexible tails with carbon numbers n ) 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , and 16. Among these , the molecules with n ) 8-16 formed a novel smectic phase. Its smectic layer possessed a liquidlike association of the molecules similar to the SmA or SmC phase , although the texture that developed from the isotropic melt was unconventional. Small fractal domains initially grew and then coalesced into several large domains. Very weak birefringence and fine structure without any anisotropy are characteristic of this phase. It is interesting to note that two different domains exist showing the opposite sign of optical rotation. Strong circular dichroism ( CD ) with a peak at 430 nm was also observed for each domain with the opposite sign. The results suggest a natural occurrence of the helix in these materials. The right - handed and left - handed helices were formed with equal probabilities , but the left - handed helix was selectively formed by the introduction of a chiral dopant. The molecule with n ) 6 formed a frustrated smectic phase , which exhibited a simple fan - shaped texture .	0
Chiral lithium amides have been utilized as bases in asymmetric deprotonation reactions and as chiral auxiliaries in other reactions.1 Koga and others have shown that chiral lithium amides can lead to high stereoselectivities in aldol and related reactions.2 The effect of these chiral lithium amides in aldol reactions , generally referred to as the Li - amide effect,3 is likely to arise from mixed aggregates containing both lithium enolates and lithium amides. Conse- quently , identification of these aggregates , including their struc- tural details , are important for designing and choosing chiral amines and for probing the origin of the stereoselectivity in asymmetric reactions involving these species. Previously , we isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction mixed aggregates containing Li - enolates and achiral Li - amides.4 We and others have suggested the importance of these species in enolate reactions.5 We now wish to report definitive evidence for a simple enolate , chiral lithium amide complex that we ’ve purposefully designed. Recently we discovered unsolvated , mixed 2 : 1 stoichiometric complexes containing Li - amide ultimately derived from (S)-N- ( 1 ) and alkyllithium reagents isopropyl-O - protected valinol depicted in Scheme 1 as 2-4.6 The similarities in size , anionic nature and potential to form mixed aggregates lead us try to replace the alkyllithium derived groups in 2-4 with an enolate. Initial attempts to form mixed aggregates were carried out using 2 equiv of the Li amide derived 1 and one equiv of Li - enolate of pinacolone or other simple ketone enolates such as from 2-bu- tanone , 3-pentanone , and 2-methyl-3-butanone in hydrocarbon solvents. With pinacolone only the known unsolvated hexameric Li - enolate of pinacolone was obtained.7 We also tried to prepare mixed aggregates between these enolates and the Li amide	0

With these results in hand , further effort to the development of an asymmetric catalysis was made using the homochiral nitrogen - containing ligands. We initially employed the easily available monooxazoline ( pymox ) and bisoxazoline ligands.11 Generally the reaction of 1a was carried out with 5 mol % Pd- (OAc)2 and 10 mol % chiral ligand in HOAc at 60 ( cid : 176 ) C. We found that the different substituent on the oxazoline ring significantly affected the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the reaction ( Table 2 ). For example , no cyclization product 2a was obtained with the benzyl-substituted bisoxazoline ligand 4a ( Table 2 , entry 1 ) and only a 29 % yield of 2a with disappointing zero enantiomeric excess employing the isopropyl-substituted bisoxazoline 4b as the ligand ( Table 2 , entry 2 ). Limited improvement was made utilizing the bisoxazoline ligand 5 to give modest levels of stereo- induction ( 68 % ee ) despite the lower yield ( 15 % ) ( Table 3 , entry 3 ). Luckily , the employment of (R)-pymox-Ph ( 6 ) or phenyl- substituted bisoxazoline 4c as the ligands led to remarkable improvement in both yield and enantioselectivity ( Table 2 , entries 4 and 5 ) .	0

Abstract : A bowl - shaped calixresorcinarene , 1 , has been derivatized to incorporate four phosphonite units to give a phosphonitocavitand , 2 , which can act as a tetradentate ligand.

The tetracopper(1) complex , 4 , and tetrasilver(1) complex , 5 , have been shown to act as size - selective hosts for halide inclusion. Iodide is preferred over chloride as guest in 4 since it is large enough to coordinate to all four copper atoms in an unusual p4-face-bridging bonding mode. The anion inclusions found for the transition metal rimmed bowl complexes are unique in supramolecular chemistry. The anion occluded complex Sa can act as a nucleophile to convert RI to RCl ; the reaction occurs in high yield , follows the reactivity sequence t-BuI > i-PrI > MeI , and occurs with predominant retention of stereochemistry in the reaction of (S)-(+)-2-iodooctane.

a noncomplexed cyclopentadienyl can not exist. It should be noted however that the log Polw values of the two rhenium complexes are quite high ( 5.31 and 5.56 , respectively ) ; however , they are noticeably lower than those obtained by Katzenellen- bogen for the rhenium chelates of progesterone. " The log Polw values for the latter are all above 6.25 , corresponding to an increase of 2.4 - 2.6 with respect to progesterone , while for organometallic complexes the increase is only 2.1. The attachment of pertinent substituents at the 11 / 3 position should decrease the partition coefficient , if needed .	0

Abstract : The solid - state low - temperature I3C N M R spectra of l-(methyl-'3C)-1-methylcyclohexane , cis-1-(methyl- ' 3C)-3,5-dimethylcyclohexane , and trans-1-(methyl-' 3C)-3,5-dimethylcyclohexane have been measured and the principal values of the I3C chemical shift tensors are reported for the labeled methyl carbons. The orientation of the principal axes of the chemical shift tensor has been estimated using ab initio calculations of the tensors. The calculated shift tensors for the axial and equatorial isomers of methylcyclohexane , which are also presented in this paper , are almost identical to those from the 3,5-dimethyl-substituted compound. This indicates that chemical shift tensors for a methyl group are primarily determined by local electronic and steric factors. Changes in steric effects and p - substituent effects between axial and equatorial methyls on the cyclohexane ring are discussed in terms of their effect upon chemical shift tensors in these paraffin hydrocarbons .	0
lent overall yield. The initial synthetic strategy called for oxidation of the methyl group of 4 directly to the carboxylic acid ( 7 ) with tetrabutylammonium permanganate ( TBA+MnO4- ). Several attempts were made , and in each case insoluble materials that were not the desired product were produced , presumably due to oxidation of the 5,6-double bond of the phenanthroline. This approach was abandoned for the stepwise method shown. Analogous to a previously reported synthesis,28 aldehyde 6 was obtained by bromination of 4 ( 2.1 equiv NBS , CC4 ) to dibromo compound 5 followed by esterification with sodium propionate in refluxing propionic acid and then hydrolysis in basic solution. Aldehyde 6 was easily oxidized to 7 with a stoichiometric amount of TBA'Mn04- in pyridine / THF. The carboxylic acid was converted into the acid chloride with oxalyl chloride and then allowed to react with 2-amino-6-picoline to give compound 1 .	0

To investigate the midstage steps of the biosynthesis of angucycline antibiotics , blocked mutant strains of the urdamycin producer S. fradiae were ~ repared. ~ From these mutant strains five new metabolites including 104-2 ( 2 ) were isolated and identified. To account for the production of 104-2 ( 2 ) , Rohr and co-workers postulated two shunt pathways.

In conclusion , the following significant points are noted : ( 1 ) the tandem oxy-Cope / transannular ring closure sequence rep- resents an important advance in the preparation of highly functionalized polyquinanes and contributes to the already considerable synthetic utility of cyclobutenone ( 2 ) synthesis of the bicyclo[3.2.0]heptenones as outlined in Scheme 2 is noteworthy not only because it provides an efficient route to these versatile synthetic intermediates but also because it presents a general and selective route to vinylketenes of the appropriate geometry to allow facile intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions ; ’* ( 3 ) we anticipate that the tandem reaction will be applicable to the synthesis of several members of the polyquinane family of natural products4-I3 and are currently investigating these possibilities in our laboratory .	0
A major advantage of this methodology is the efficiency and ease with which the auxiliary is removed. Hydrolysis of the alkylation products occurs rapidly in the presence of sodium hydroxide ( 2 equiv ) in water or water-methanol mixtures at reflux. The aqueous hydrolysis mixture is extracted with dichloromethane to remove the pseudoephedrine auxiliary ( 96 % recovery ). The alkaline , aqueous product solution is then treated with acylating agents such as di-tert-butyl dicarbonate or 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate in the presence of sodium bicarbonate ( 2.0 equiv , to quench excess hydroxide ) , to afford directly the corresponding Boc or Fmoc N - protected a-amino acids ( Table 2 ). The yield of this hydrolysis / N-protection procedure typically exceeds 90 % , and , where substrates of 299 % de are employed , products of 299 % ee are often obtained. The rate of alkaline hydrolysis of these a-amino amides is much faster than that of their hydrocarbon counter- p a r t ~ . ~ This is believed to be due to acceleration of the ( rate-	0

Abstract : Poly(o-aminobenzylphosphonic acid ) and its sodium salts , made by progressive neutralization with NaOH , have been prepared and characterized. Both the hemisodium and monosodium salts are intrinsically self - doped and water - soluble in the conducting form. The key is to control the ionization of the excess acid functions on the polymer chains. XPS results suggest that the polymer is obtained directly in the 43 % polyzwitterionic ( Le. , self - doped ) emeraldine form. The self - doped polymer does not exhibit any conductivity dependence on pH below 6 , in marked contrast to the HC1 - doped polyanilines. Our structurally well - defined polymer system displays only one set of redox activity over the potential range of -0.2 to 1.2 eV , alluding to the higher stability of the self - doped structure. This is unique and different from other polyaniline systems which show two sets of redox peaks. FTIR spectroscopy provides evidence for strong intra-chain hydrogen bonding while NMR studies conclude that protonated and S cm- ’ ) unprotonated segments of the solvated monosodium polymer are distinct. The lower conductivity obtained is attributed to the decrease in conjugation caused by the large steric effect of the bulky PO3H2 and a significant hydrogen bond interaction between P02(0H)- and NH’+ leading to significant charge - pinning. UV - vis data can be explained by a increased participation of the nitrogen wave function in the HOMO , and thereby the	0

The decarboxylation of benzisoxazole-3-carboxylic acids to form salicylonitriles has been investigated in extraordinary detail by Kemp et al. ’ The reaction involves the conversion of the conjugate base of benzisoxazole-3-carboxylic acid ( 1 ) to cy- anophenoxide 3 , without formation of an intermediate ( Scheme 1 ). The reaction rate is enormously sensitive to solvent polarity. There is a 108-fold increase in rate on changing the reaction medium from polar protic ( H20 ) to polar aprotic ( hexameth- ylphosphoramide ). This has been explained by ( 1 ) stabilization of the carboxylate in protic media by hydrogen bonding , which raises the activation energy , and ( 2 ) stabilization of the charge- delocalized transition state , 2 through dispersion interactions with polarizable media. The second explanation rests on the assumption that the extended n-system is easier to polarize in the transition state than in the ground state. The importance of medium effects has been further defined through catalysis of the reaction by cationic and nonionic surfactants,2 polymeric crown ether^,^ and antib ~ dies , ~ which speed up the reaction by factors of 4 x lo2 , 2 x lo3 , and 1 x lo4 , respectively , even in aqueous solution. Kinetic isotope effects for a I3CO2- labeled structure have been measured by Hilvert et al. for the reactions	0

Department of Organic Chemistry The Weizmann Institute of Science Rehovot 76100 , Israel Received January 17 , 1995 Intermolecular activation of the strong C-F bonds ' by soluble transition - metal complexes2-I3 is an area of major current interest. Remarkable results achieved in the field include metal- assisted C-F activation reactions of aromatic2-I0 and ole- finic'1.'2 substrates , synthesis in solution of v2- and v4-C6F6 complexes of rhodium and iridium , some of which are proposed as intermediates in C-F activation of fluoroarene ~ , ~ .' ~ -' ~ and , finally , recent activation of aliphatic perfluorinated substrates by Fe , C013 , and U9 complexes. Despite this obvious progress , which has also resulted in publication of a review on the topic , " it was not until only recently that first examples of homoge- neous transition - metal - catalyzed C-F activation reactions were reported. After we discovered that rhodium silyl complexes can catalyze F / H exchange between hydrosilanes and hexa- or pentafluorobenzene under mild conditions,'* we set ourselves a task to try to generalize this approach. Here we report that C-F bonds of C6F6 and C & H can be efficiently and selectively hydrogenolyzed in a simple reaction with H2 and a base with trimethylphosphine complexes of rhodium as catalysts. Heating of L3RhC6F5Is ( 1 ) or L4RhH20 ( 2 ) ( L = PMe3 ) at 95-100 " c in C6F6 or C & H in presence of a base ( Et3N or a mixture of Et3N and K2CO3 ) under 85 psi of hydrogen leads to the substitution of F by H and capturing of the released HF by the base ( eq 1 ) .	0

These signals may arise by formation of new oligomers and by slowing of the odoff chelation of the dimethylamido side arm as well as by solvent attack.3d It is noteworthy that the most reactive species in solution may be present in relatively small amounts. Even though only 17 % of mixed base is observed at room temperature , this component may be important in the reactivity of the mixture .	0

How does zinc modulate the nucleophilicity of the coordinated thiolate compared to that of the free thiol ? We have begun to address these questions through the use of small - molecule model chemistry. In this initial study , we report the use of [(CH3)4N]2- [ Zn(SC & )4]'4 to represent the [ Zn(S-cys)4I2- site of Ada and (CH30)3P(O) to mimic the DNA methylphosphotriester lesion.

( 1,3-bisdiphenylphosphinopropane ) was employed as a catalyst , rapid ( cid : 226 ) - hydride elimination is claimed to have followed the 2,1- insertion of styrene , affording mainly dimers but not polymers.2 Unlike other phosphorus ligands , (R,S)-BINAPHOS gave a copolymer of 4-tert-butylstyrene and CO , and thus , enantio- selective alternating copolymerization has been achieved.7,8 Here we reveal that exclusive 1,2-insertion is responsible for the styrene-CO copolymerization with Pd-(R,S)-BINAPHOS ( Scheme 1 , Figure 1 ). This unique regioselectivity is suggested to explain why a regiocontrolled alternating copolymer was obtained with this particular phosphorus ligand.

Herein we wish to report on a new type of surface modifica- tion , which essentially rests upon attachment of theophylline to a polyurethane surface. Theophylline ( 1 ) is a xanthine - based heterocycle , which potentiates the inhibition of platelet aggrega- tion by prostaglandins. Our choice for theophylline was primarily based on earlier work by Bamford et a1.,6 who have incorporated the drug into a new type of water - soluble polymer. These workers observed that the resulting materials exhibit a marked inhibitory effect with respect to the activation of blood platelets.6a	0
We report the first detailed characterization for the nonen- zymatic oxidation of benzylamine by topaquinone analogs , as well as 0- and p-quinones. As demonstrated , o-quinones give relatively weak turnover comparable to topaquinone analogs , whereas p-quinones ( 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 ) are inert. The overall properties of each of these catalysts and their reaction products indicate that the 2-hydroxyl group of topaquinone plays a substantial role in preventing the formation of Michael adducts with substrate amine and in facilitating the reoxidation of aminoresorcinol intermediates .	0
In the preceding paper,g we report the first detailed study of the non-enzymatic oxidation of benzylamine by topaquinone analogs in an organic solvent ( CH3CN ). It is shown that 2-hydroxy- 1 ,4-benzoquinones bearing a bulky substituent at C5 position ( la,c ) can act as efficient turnover catalysts in the model system. The 2-hydroxyl group of the quinone is found to be an important component of its catalytic activity. It is proposed that the 2-hydroxyl group plays important roles in protecting the quinone ring from ring amination and in directing the reaction at CI , as well as in mediating the stability and reactivity of various intermediates. The methoxy group at the C2 position of the p-quinone ( 2 ) has the effect of directing the reaction to the CI carbonyl carbon , but at a greatly reduced rate relative to topa analogs. The o-quinone ( 3 ) shows reduced turnover relative to topa analogs , attributed in part to a less negative redox potential .	0

Stereochemical studies on both enzymatic reactions have been completed. It has been determined that the product of CHMI , 2-oxo-5-(carboxymethyl)-3-hexenedioate ( 2 ) , has the R configuration at C-5. In addition , these studies show that the enzymatic decarboxylation of 2 by COHED generates (42)-2- hydroxy-2,4-heptadiene- 1,7-dioate ( 3 ). Isolation and subsequent incubation of ( 43-3 with C O E D , in *H20 , affords predominantly (3S)-[3-*H]5. On the basis of these stereochemical findings , it can be concluded that the loss of carbon dioxide and the incorporation of a deuteron occur on the same side of the dienol intermediate. These results are consistent with the working hypotheses for the mechanisms of both enzymes and indicate that the sequence of events catalyzed by these two enzymes parallel the reactions catalyzed by 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase and 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase in the catechol meta-fission pathway .	0

key is chained to a planar dipyrrinone lock ( Figure 5 ). If the chain is sufficiently long , two units can be tethered in a stacked arrangement by a matrix of six intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Surprisingly , stacked dimers are apparently assembled even with very long alkanoic acid chains ( Table I ). These dimers resemble small open - ended boxes with dipyrrinone tops and bottoms and two hydrocarbon walls ( Figure 5 ) that can be expanded ( according to chain length ) to accommodate or encapsulate guest molecules .	0
investigation we report the outcome of a detailed screening program conducted with diol 1 and potential guest species. Our aims were to explore the range of guest sizes and functionalities which could be accommodated , the interdependence between host and guest species , and the mechanisms by which the hydrogen - bonded host lattice adapts to guests of different size. We find that 1 forms inclusion compounds with guests containing a surprisingly diverse range of functionality. Forty inclusion compounds have been prepared and characterized. The structures of 12 of these have been determined by X-ray crystallography and are reported here in full. These guest molecules of differing size and shape can result in significant alteration to the unit cell and canal dimensions but do not cause disruption of the helical tubuland lattice type itself. The crystal structures reveal how this is achieved and also provide significant information about host - guest and guest - guest arrangements within the canals. Evidence is presented dem- onstrating that the remarkable canal structure of 1 can persist in the guest - free state .	0

Abstract : The concept of dendritic networks via four bis(2,2¢ : 6¢ ,2¢ ¢ -terpyridine)ruthenium(II) connectivities was utilized to create “ dendritic methane ” - type metallomacromolecules. In addition , two structurally isomeric metallodendrimers ( 16 and 17 ) were designed , synthesized , and characterized. These two isomers were spectrally alike and displayed very similar physical and chemical properties ; however , the internal density and void regions of these molecules were differentiated by cyclic voltammetry. The effects of the bulkiness of internal and external dendritic branches on the terpyridine-ruthenium complexes are described. A similar synthetic strategy allowed the preparation of two generations of neutral metallomacromolecules ( 33 and 36 ) possessing no external counterions. The benefits of these internally charge - balanced , neutral species are described , and the effects of increasing dendritic branching on their electrochemical behavior are detailed .	0

Comparison to Other Methods for Measuring S. Three other methods can be ( or have been ) used to calculate 6 in 18 + 6 complexes. ( 1 ) In a previous paper , EPR spectroscopy gave a value of 6 e 0.016 for the Co(CO)3L2 complex in frozen toluene.6 The value obtained by EPR is not directly comparable to that obtained by IR because EPR gives a measurement of the metal 3d spin density , whereas the IR method reported herein yields a charge density. However , the results of the two methods should be reasonably close , as indeed they are. ( 2 ) An SCF-Xa-SW calculation on the Co(CO)3L2 complex found 6 = 0.02.5 The X a method is good for calculating electronic charges and its results should be comparable to those obtained by IR spectroscopy ( 0.05 in CH2C12 ).

1,2-Diazene , also known as diimide , N2H2 , is widely used for reducing multiple bonds.' It is highly selective and stereospecific and has been in wide use since the early 1960s. An unusual feature of its chemistry is that diazene is believed to react through a pericyclic transition state , with both hydrogen atoms donating across the multiple bond. In recent experimental investigations we have measured the kinetics of diimide reduction of itself in aqueous media , i.e. , its disproportionation.2 We found that the rate law , rate constant , and activation parameters were in agreement with ab initio calculations based on the following scenario : ( 1 ) trans-NzH2 is in solvent - catalyzed equilibrium with its high - energy cis isomer , and ( 2 ) the cis isomer donates both hydrogen atoms in a concerted pericyclic manner with virtually no activation enthalpy , the transition state being highly entropy controlled.

Abstract : We have investigated fluorine substitution effects on the rate of coupling of adsorbed alkyl groups on a Ag(ll1) surface. Alkyl groups are formed by thermal dissociation of the C-I bond in adsorbed alkyl iodides. Variable heating rate temperature programmed reaction ( TPR ) studies were used to determine the kinetic parameters for the coupling of ethyl groups and propyl groups. They are Ea = 15.1 f 0.6 kcallmol , Y = 10'6.7*0.8 S-I and E , = 16.9 f 0.4 kcallmol , Y = 1017.1*0.4 s-l , respectively. Substitution of fluorine for hydrogen in the adsorbed alkyl groups systematically raises the coupling reaction temperature. For example , trifluoropropyl groups self - couple at temperatures -70 K higher than propyl groups on Ag( 11 1 ). Coadsorbed propyl and trifluoropropyl groups cross- couple at temperatures -10 K higher than the propyl self - coupling reaction. The kinetic parameters evaluated from the results of this study and from results of earlier studies by X.-L. Zhou , J. M. White , and co-workers [ S u ~ Sci. 1989 , 219 , 294 ; Catal. Lett. 1989 , 2 , 375 ; J. Phys. Chem. 1991 , 95 , 55751 are used to plot linear free energy relationships ( LFER ) which provide insight into the electronic nature of the reaction center. The implication of the LFER plots for the surface alkyl coupling reaction is that the reaction center in the transition state is electron deficient with respect to the initial state .	0

Here , we design a triangular panel - like ligand with four donor sites on the two edges of the triangle ( two donor sites on each edge ) : namely , compound 1 in Scheme 1. Having two - point binding sites on its two edges , this triangular unit is expected to assemble into edge- sharing polyhedral entity upon complexation with (en)Pd(NO3)2 ( 2 ) , which is a versatile 90 ( cid : 176 ) coordination unit for metal - directed assembly. Whereas previous triangular ligands all possess C3 sym- metry,1-4 panel 1 is C2 - symmetric and hence can be linked in two different ways : parallel and antiparallel links. Interestingly , these two options were perfectly controlled by the guests.5 We show that some large guests induce the parallel link of the triangles leading to open cone ( tetragonal pyramidal ) structure 3 , whereas antiparallel link is selected by some small tetrahedral guests giving closed tetrahedron structure 4 ( Scheme 1 ). Both assemblies have the same M8L4 composition and , therefore , constitute a dynamic receptor library6,7 from which each receptor is selected by its optimal guests .	0

Additional evidence arguing against the participation of freely diffusible ' OH was obtained from the DNA cleavage experi- ments. DNA damage induced by ' OH , generated either by y-irradiation or Fe(II ). EDTA / H202 , produces a characteristic cleavage ladder , composed of two closely spaced bands at each cleavage ~ i t e . 4 ~ These doublet bands correspond to a mixture of fragments terminating in 3'-phosphates and 3'-phosphoro- glycolates and are a result of direct strand s c i ~ s i o n .

This type of mechanism normally results directly in strand scission,2b,14dhs44 as opposed , or in addition to the formation of alkali - labile sites ; therefore , this type of mechanism can also be ruled out .	0

Several theoretical models5q9 and empirical rulesk.g have been put forward over the years to account for the observed diastereoselectivities , neither of which gives a consistent rationalization of all the experimental data. Additionally , a computational study on model reactions by Dannenbergsb revealed that several transition states of similar energy are involved for both the like and the unlike cycloaddition pathways. This ineffective discrimination between the different transition state conformations is reflected in the moderate n-facial selectivities for simple dienes ( Scheme 1 ) .	0
The results presented here , combined with those obtained previously using osmium and rhodium porphyrin catalysts , illustrate the strong metal dependence of the diastereoselectivity and substrate preferences exhibited in porphyrin - mediated cyclopropanation reactions. The neutral osmium(I1) and iron- ( 11 ) catalysts provide the trans cyclopropyl ester as the major product and the influence of the groups appended to the porphyrin macrocycle is quite modest. Aryl or heteroatom- substituted alkenes are cyclopropanated much more efficiently than aliphatic alkenes , and only monosubstituted and 1,l- disubstituted alkenes are good substrates. The rhodium por- phyrin - catalyzed reaction has strikingly different properties. Almost equal amounts of the cis and trans products are obtained with sterically unencumbered porphyrin ligands , but when bowl- shaped ligands such as TMP are employed , synthetically useful excesses of the cis product are produced. Furthermore , these reactions exhibit a very broad substrate compatibility. The electronic nature of the alkene substituent has little or no effect and only bulky tetrasubstituted alkenes are cyclopropanated inefficiently. The only exception is when the alkene substituents are very large. In these cases , monosubstituted alkenes are the preferred substrates .	0
Abstract : Second - order rate constants ( kxpy ) have been measured for the displacement reaction between substituted pyridines ( xpy ) and 1’-(2,6-diphenoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)pyridinium ion in aqueous solution. The rate constants for the reverse reaction ( k-xpy ) have also been measured for substituted pyridine leaving groups. The plots of log kxpy and log k-XPY against pKaxPY each consist of two intersecting linear correlations consistent with a two - step mechanism involving a Meisenheimer - like intermediate. The overall transfer of the triazin-2-yl group between substituted pyridines has a Peq value of 1.25. There is negligible coupling between the bonding changes in both steps , and the substituent effects indicate that bond formation is half complete in the addition step. Reaction of substituted pyridines with 2,6-diphenoxy-l,3,5-triazin-2-y1 chloride has a similar bonding change in the addition step. The 1’-triazin-2- ylpyridinium ion species exist in aqueous solution in equilibrium with the pseudobase formed by addition of water at the 2-position of the pyridinium ring .	0

A kinetic study of catalytic epoxidation of a series of styrenes by CH3Re03-H202 has been carried out in acidic CH3CN / H20 to determine the reactivities of A and B and other features of the mechanism. The mixed solvent was chosen to promote solubility of the styrenes , and water and acidic conditions greatly increased catalyst stability in peroxide solutions. The major products were isolated and identified by H - NMR experiments ; some of these determinations were made in neat acetonitrile. We have conducted detailed kinetic studies of the complicated catalytic system shown in Scheme 1. It involves two active species , A and B , formed from H202 and MTO. These rhenium peroxides react independently with the styrene.

of these dimethylamino acids , which reflect the carboxylate functionality of the zwitterions , have a band at 1630.0 f 1.0 cm-' and the dimethylamino acid hydrochloride salts , which reflect the carboxylic acid functionality of the un-ionized dimethylamino acid , have a band at 1725 f 2.3 cm-'. Thus , for any particular dimethylamino acid in DMSO , the relative intensities of bands in these regions indicate the relative concentrations of the two tautomers. From Table 1 , the VCQ stretch of N,N-dimethylglycine ( l ) , which is known to exist predominantly as the zwitterion tautomer in DMSO,2' appears at 1638 cm-l. For the other dimethylamino acids , in addition to the band at 1634.7 f 1.0 cm-' , there is a band at 1710 & 2.3 cm-' and another near 2800 cm-'. The band near 2800 cm-' indicates the presence of the neutral tautomer.22 It is obvious from Table 1 that as the number of alkyl groups bonded to the / 3-carbon of dimethylamino acids increases , the intensity of the band at 1710 f 2.3 cm-I increases ; however , a quantitative assessment of the tautomeric distribution can not be achieved by this method .	0

Native PAGE and UV - monitored thermal denaturation mea- surements confirmed the ability of several spin - labeled DNA strands to complex with partner strands. In a representative example , a 1 : 1 mixture of single strands IB and IIB ( see Table 1 ) gave a predominant native PAGE band of lower mobility than the individual strands , but similar to the DNA duplex IA*IIA containing only the naturally occurring bases. Spin- labeled strand IB was admixed independently with each of the five potential partner strands IIA - IIE ; for each pairing , the melting temperature and extent of hyperchromicity were quanti- fied at 260 nm ( Table 1 ).

Abstract : We have developed a new class of metal - loaded nanoparticles that have potential as contrast agents for medical imaging. These polymeric materials have a core - shell morphology where the interior is a functionalized polymer , that provides high affinity for a specific metal , and the shell consists of a porous hydrophobic polymer that modulates access to the core. In the present case , the nanoparticles are loaded with Gd3+ to provide contrast in magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging. The Gd3+ - loaded nanoparticles described in this paper have a diameter of 120 nm and are , therefore , small enough to pass easily through the vasculature. These particles have been shown to reduce relaxation times in vitro , and provide excellent contrast when used to image the heart and gastrointestinal tract in a rat animal model .	0

The indirect halo acetal method was developed by Stork19 and Ueno20 because direct cyclization of R-halo esters into ( cid : 231 ) - butyrolactones is an inefficient process.21 Lactones are usually produced from this strategy by oxidation of the products prepared from radical cyclization of bromo acetal , as shown in iodoacetate 3a with Scheme 2.

Abstract : The intramolecular aldol condensation of keto-aldehyde 1 yields a substituted 2-benzyl-3-hydroxy- cyclohexanone 2 and subsequently 2-benzyl-2-cyclohexenone ( 3 ). The sequence involves four individual reaction steps. Three of these steps can be accelerated using general acid - base catalysis to effect proton transfer at or near the a-carbon of the ketone involved in the condensation , which is at the homobenzylic position relative to the aromatic group of the substrate ( Ar ). An antibody to the corresponding N-benzyl-N-methylpiperidinium hapten 5 was found to catalyze the entire reaction sequence. This antibody seems to act purely as a general base and does not catalyze the carbon-carbon bond forming step. Catalysis of the aldol elimination is selective for the disfavored trans- elimination with a single enantiomer of stereoisomer 2a. Catalysis is suppressed by incubating the antibody with a carboxyl-specific reagent , suggesting that a carboxyl group acts as a general base to catalyze the sequence. The antibody is approximately 2.0 x lo5 times more reactive than acetate for catalysis of the sequence. These experiments demonstrate that catalysis of reactions with several consecutive transition states is possible using catalytic antibodies .	0
Also the leaving group may act as the hydron acceptor. A more basic leaving group is expected to favor elimination relative to substitution through the ion pair. The results of this work ( Table 1 ) show an approximately constant kldks ratio with decreasing basicity of the leaving group in the series OBs- > Br- > 1- which may suggest that the solvent is the dominant hydron abstractor in this system. An increasing elimination- to - substitution ratio is expected for solvent - promoted E2 reaction which is manifested as a very large change in kldks with leaving group ( Table 1 ) .	0

Abstract : The role of local steric influences on the solution conformation and the biological activity of the H - type II blood group determinant 1 has been evaluated using structurally modified trisaccharides 2-4 and their corresponding C1 - substituted C-glycosides 5-8 as conformational models. The preference of the C-glycosidic bond to adopt the gauche “ exo-anomeric ” conformation and the removal of destabilizing 1,3-diaxial - like interactions on the C-aglyconic bond have been used to create predictable conformational characteristics in C-trisaccharides 5-8. Vicinal coupling constants from ‘ H NMR spectroscopy and 2D NOESY spectroscopy demonstrate that structural modifications in the C-trisaccharides result in large changes in their conformational preferences. To test the impact of solution conformation on receptor - ligand recognition , the affinities of compounds 1-8 toward the lectin I of Ulex europaeus ( UEA-I ) have been investigated using a quantitative binding assay. The binding affinities of the H - type 11 trisaccharide 1 and the corresponding carbon analog 5 are virtually identical. The activities of the structurally modified C-trisaccharides 6-8 decrease sharply relative to the unmodified C-trisaccharide 5 , correlating conformation to binding affinity. A parallel gradient in binding affinity is observed for the 0-trisaccharides 1-4. The selectivity of UEA-I for epitopes 1-8 validates the assumption that its receptor site largely defines a bound conformation for the substrates , and establishes that the conformational behavior of 0-glycosides such as 1-4 is similar to that of C-glycosides such as 5-8 .	0

Abstract : A new strategy has been devised for the construction of photoactive multicomponent arrays based on metal ion chelation whereby bisporphyrins have been assembled around a central ruthenium( @ bis(terpyridy1) complex. One of the terminal subunits is a gold(II1) porphyrin while the second terminus is selected from a gold(III) , zinc(II) , or free - base porphyrin. Photophysical properties have been measured for each of the tripartite compounds using ultrafast transient absorption and emission spectroscopy. Excitation into the central ruthenium(I1) bis(terpyridy1) complex is followed by rapid intramolecular triplet energy transfer to one of the appended porphyrins. Direct excitation into the gold(II1) porphyrin subunit generates the corresponding triplet excited state which is unreactive toward energy- or electron - transfer processes. In contrast , excitation into the zinc(II) or free - base porphyrin produces the corresponding excited singlet state which transfers an electron to the adjacent ruthenium(II) bis(terpyridy1) complex. Secondary electron transfer to the appended gold(II1) porphyrin competes with reverse electron transfer such that the redox equivalents become separated by about 30 A. The original ground - state system is restored by relatively slow interporphyrin electron transfer. The energetics for each of these electron - transfer steps have been evaluated from electrochemical measurements and by measuring the rates as a function of temperature and solvent polarity. For the zinc(I1) porphyrin - containing triad , electron transfer takes place in the solid state at 77 K. Finally , the performance of the latter triad is compared with that of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center complex .	0

When 3(BF4-) is dissolved in acetonitrile-d3 , the acetonitrile ligand trans to hydride exchanges with the solvent. Within 20 min or less , the exchange is complete. The other two acetonitrile ligands also exchange with solvent , but only very slowly ( virtually complete after 3 days ) .	0

Based on these arguments , the observed VCD spectra of the three tetrapeptides can be categorized by a combination of C = OI / C = O : ! and C = Ol / C = O3 interactions ( low - frequency couplet ) and a C = 02 / C = 03 interaction ( high - frequency cou- plet ). The eigenvectors of the coupling energy matrix provide a description of the modes resulting from the coupling of the transitions of the individual amide transitions. Inspection of Tables 4 and 6 reveals that the resulting modes are similar for the type I and type I1 / ? -turns , although their coupling energies and VCD intensities are quite different. The eigenvectors demonstrate that the low - frequency vibration at ca. 1642 cm- ’ is largely due to the C = OI vibration. In both cases , the highest frequency vibrations ( ca. 1692 cm-I ) may be attributed largely to an in-phase combination of the C = O2 / C = O3 groups ; how- ever , the contribution of the C = O1 coordinate to this vibration differs in sign between the type I and type I1 turns. The 1680- cm- ’ vibrations in both types of tums are due to the out - of - phase combination of the C = O2 / C = O3 groups .	0
Abstract : The first in situ kinetics investigation of benzene formation from acetylene ( 2.5 L ) on Pd(ll1) is reported. Laser - induced thermal desorption with Fourier transform mass spectrometry is used to monitor the surface molecular composition as a function of temperature and reaction time. The reaction occurs in a stepwise mechanism , the rate - determining step being the reaction of 1 equiv of acetylene with 1 equiv of C & surface intermediate ( formed at -1 10 K ) to form benzene. At low temperatures ( 1210 K ) , the reaction is self - poisoning by site blocking , and the reaction ceases with excess acetylene remaining. Heating to 260 K , however , drives the reaction to completion. Below 210 K , the reaction is observed to be pseudo zeroth order in acetylene surface concentration , but follows pseudo-first-order kinetics overall. The activation barrier for benzene formation is 43.5 f 4.5 kJ / mol with a preexponential of 109.s*0.1 s-' , Additionally , butadiene is observed , confirming the presence of C4 species on the surface .	0
One of the important insights of molecular biology obtained in the last few years is the elucidation of a mechanism for the ability of eucaryotic cells to recognize their location in tissue. The mechanism of tissue recognition has been traced to the interaction of a relatively small number of extracellular tissue markers with corresponding receptors at the cell surface.

The data we report for 3’,4’-dibutyl-2,2 ’ : 5’,2 ” -terthiophene , 3 ” ,4 ” -dibutyl-2,2 ’ : 5’,2 ” : 5 ” ,2 ” ’ : 5 ” ’,2 ” ” -pentathiophene , and 3’,4’,3 ” ” ’’ ” -tetrabutyl- 2,2 ‘ : ~ ~ ,2 ” : 5 “ ,2 “ ‘ : 5 “ ‘ ,2 ‘ ‘ “ : 5 “ “ ,2 “ “ ‘ -sexithiophene indicate that the ground state isomerization barrier for all of these oligomers is on the order of 8 kcavmol , with no discernible dependence on the length of the oligomer. For oligomer isomerization in the SI electronic state , we find that the isomerization barrier for both the pentathiophene and sexithiophene oligomer is -5.2 kcal / mol , slightly larger than the value we reported previously for SI 3’,4’-dibutyl- 2,2 ’ : 5’,2 ” -terthiophene. Experimental data for both electronic states in these oligomers are in excellent agreement with semiempirical calculations using the PM3 parametrization .	0

The dihydroisochroman-3-one ligand in 5- has not previously been reported and presents an interesting array of functionalities derived in a straightforward manner from benzene. The ligand was easily removed by oxidation of K5 prepared from 0.23 g of lPF6 in THF ( 50 mL ) with 0 2 at room ( 0.64 " 01 ) temperature overnight. The solvent was removed from the bright yellow filtered solution under vacuum , and the solid was washed with toluene.

As with a-oxoketene3 and imid ~ ylketene , ~ substitutents with an unshared pair of electrons ( NH2 , OH , SH , OCH3 , and N(CH3)2 ) lead to lower barriers while a methyl group destabi- lizes the four - center transition structure ( Table 1 ). The migra- tory aptitudes decrease in the order N(CH3)2 > SCH3 > NHCH3 > SH > OCH3 > N H 2 > OH > H > CH3. The stabilizing effect of the electron - rich substituents is readily understood in terms of the favorable interaction between the R group and the vacant central carbon p orbital of the ketene ( or allene ) moiety in the molecular plane ( this is illustrated in Figure 2 in the supporting information ) .	0
The new Fe(porphyrin)(NO) complexes la-f are readily prepared by reductive nitrosylation of the corresponding Fe- (porphyrin)Cl complexes by treating them with nitric oxide in the presence of excess methanol and 2,6-lutidine.I1 The characteristic data collected in Table 1 are typical of paramag- netic ferrous nitrosyl adducts , in which the nitric oxide adopts a bent geometry and the iron is five coordinate.I2 The only significantly variable type of data for la-f in Table 1 is the potential of the Fe(II) / Fe(III) couple , which increases by -500 mV upon incorporation of more electron - withdrawing substit- uents on the aryl ring or the porphyrin ring.

The reaction exhibits extraordinary chemoselectivity. The fact that the highly reactive products , a & unsaturated aldehydes and ketones , are isolated in excellent yields attests to this fact. An isolated carbonyl group ( entry 2 ) , ester ( entry 3 ) , unprotected alcohol ( entry 4 ) , alkyne ( entry 5 ) , and terminal alkene ( entry 8 ) are completely unaffected. The latter is particularly note- worthy since some isomerization of a terminal alkene to an internal alkene had been noted with 3 previou ~ ly. ~ Complete control of alkene geometry favoring the E isomers occurred as shown by GC and NMR analysis.

SOC. , Vol. 117 , No. 37 , 1995 9599 Mukaiyama aldol reactions of (2)-enolsilane 4b ( Scheme 3 , eqs 9 and 10 ) are equally exciting since the normally observed face selectivity for boron and titanium enolates ( 1,3-syn-dimethyl ) has been reversed ( 1,3-anti-dimethyl ) in these enolsilane vari- ants. It is also important to note that each of these Lewis acid- promoted syn aldol reactions provides the Felkin diastereomer with high selectivity. At the present time , this type of aldol bond construction is generally difficult to perform in high selectivity utilizing metal enolate technology.I6	0

( 1 ) As shown in Scheme 3 , the cyclobutene substrate may first undergo a ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) , which is then followed by a depolymerization of the living polymer by the remaining terminal olefin to produce selectively the observed m0n0mer.l ~ An attractive feature of this scenario is that the terminal olefin ’s initial lack of self - metathesis is explained by the sequestering of the ruthenium alkylidene on the terminus of the living polymer. However , in the context of this mechanistic sequence , it is noteworthy that treatment of preformed living polymer ( made from 2 ) with 1-octene affords the desired monomer 7 , albeit in low yield ( 15 % ).

The absorption of the cage drops off at 300 nm , making the ( n,n* ) transition of acetophenone accessible by the direct absorption of light. The absorption spectra of l*Ac and acetophenone are superimposable , showing that incarceration does not distort the absorption spectrum of acetophenone. Irradiation of l*Ac at 320 nm in a methyltetrahydrofuran ( MTHF ) matrix at 77 K yields a species with a lifetime of 10.1 ms and an emission spectrum containing the four vibrational bands charcteristic of acetophenone phosphorescence. In order to determine if triplet energy would be transferred through the skeleton of l*Ac , samples in which naphthalene was added to the MTHF matrix were irradiated. As the concentration of naphthalene in the MTHF matrix was increased , l*Ac phos- phorescence intensity decreased while naphthalene phospho- rescence was induced. Naphthalene phosphorescence was not seen upon direct irradiation of naphthalene , so triplet energy must be transferred through the skeleton of 1 in these experi- ments. The method of Terenin and Ermolaev ” was used to obtain formal rate constants of triplet energy transfer of 79 s-I for l*Ac and 300 s-l for uncomplexed acetophenone. Since the radial distribution of quencher molecules about the 1-Ac and acetophenone donors should be the same in the glass , there is only a modest difference in transfer efficiencies in this case. This is consistent with the observation that the millisecond triplet lifetimes feasible at 77 K enable triplet energy transfer to span 10-15 8 , distances.I2	0

from the electrochemical hydroxymethylations of ( cid : 226)-silylcyclo- alkanone enol acetates. The transformation is initiated by depro- tonation of 4 with NaOMe. The resultant canonical form 712 overwhelms form 8 because of the silicon ( cid : 226 ) - destabilizing effect. Around the anode , the dissociated ( cid : 226 ) - silyl enolate ions react with CH2dO+H , which is generated from the solvent MeOH through electrochemical oxidation,13 to produce hydroxymethylated enol acetate 9. Hydrolysis of 9 under acidic conditions affords the R¢ - monohydroxymethyl ketone 5. The first step of the entire mechanism is the equilibrium process 4 + -OMe f 7 + MeOH. Although this equilibrium disfavors the formation of the inter- mediate 7 , it could strongly couple with the CH2dO+H species generated in situ. After its concentration decreases , the Le Chatelier ’s principle is applied to the system and drives the reaction to product 5 as shown in Scheme 3 .	0

A quite different result was observed in the case of the carbanion derived from trans-2-methyl-4-phenyl- 1,3-dioxane ( 6 ). Treatment of 6 with Lochmann - Schlosser base followed by EtOD quenching led to a total of 56 % deuterium incorpora- tion. The 2H NMR spectrum indicated that 19 % of D was situated at the 4e position and 10.5 % at the 4a position ( of the remainder , 19 % was in the phenyl ring ). Thus the ratio of 10 : 11 in the product was 1.8 : l. A very similar ratio ( 2.5 : l ) was obtained from the epimeric cis-2-methyl-4-phenyl- 1,3-dioxane ( 12 ) , suggesting hydrogen abstraction at C(4) can occur from either the equatorial or axial position , that the two reactions pass through the same carbanion , and that the deuteronation of that carbanion is not stereoselective .	0

Abstract : Construction of sulfones in enantiomerically pure form provides a great opportunity to enhance their value as synthetic building blocks. Allylic sulfones , in particular , have great flexibility derived from sulfone - controlled additions to the double bond. Two strategies have been developed based upon the ability to effect asymmetric allylic alkylations with palladium employing ligands derived from c2 symmetric diamines and 2-(dipheny1phosphino)- benzoic acid. Desymmetrization of meso-2-ene- 1 ,Cdiol diesters does not involve the nucleophile in the enantio- discriminating step and thus should , a priori , not depend upon the nature of the nucleophile. Indeed , such desymmetrization of such a diester in the presence of a sulfinate anion gave excellent enantioselectivity. On the other hand , conversion of both enantiomeric allylic esters to enantiomerically pure allylic sulfones requires sodium benzenesulfinate to participate in the enantiodiscriminating step. Five- , six- , and seven - membered substrates all gave excellent enantioselectivities. A catalytic phase transfer system proved most efficacious on larger scales. Propagating the asymmetry requires diastereoselective functionalization of the double bond. While epoxidation proved excellent for the five - membered ring case and satisfactory for the six - membered ring case , it was unsatisfactory in the seven - membered ring case. Osmium tetroxide - catalyzed cis-dihydroxylation gave excellent diastereoselectivities in the six- and seven - membered ring cases. Reductive cleavages produced enantiomerically pure allylic alcohols. Base - catalyzed elimination generated enantiomerically pure y-hydroxy-a,B-unsaturated sulfones from which further stereogenic centers were produced by diastereoselective conjugate additions. Notably , an asymmetric cyclopentenone annulation using palladium - catalyzed cycloadditions now derives from racemic allyl alcohols .	0
Abstract : 1,3-Dipolar cycloadditions of N-methyl-C , C-diphenylnitrone ( 15 ) and N-methyl-C-phenylnitrone ( 16 ) with aliphatic thioketones are equilibrium reactions. The 1,4,2-0xathiazolidines were characterized and their dissociation of the adduct 28 from 16 and constants measured by 'H NMR analysis and by visible spectrophotometry. 2,2,6,6-tetramethylcyclohexanethione ( 27 ) was determined from 20-76 " C , revealing & & d = - 10.8 kcal mol-' and 1 ? LS & = -28 eu. The inertness of diary1 thioketones vs nitrones has thermodynamic reasons. According to rate measurements with 16 , the activity of the highly hindered thione 27 exceeds 5-fold that of dimethyl acetylenedi- carboxylate ( DMAD ) , the top dipolarophile with a CC multiple bond ; the cycloaddition to adamantanethione-despite adverse steric effects-is 1500 times faster than that to DMAD. Rate constants for the cycloaddition of 16 to 2,2,4,4- tetramethyl-3-thioxocyclobutanone ( 10 ) were measured in 12 solvents. The small and slightly inverse relation to solvent polarity rules out a zwitterionic intermediate but is consistent with a concerted pathway .	0
Abstract : The chiral tetraarylvinyl propeller 1,2-bis(4-tert-buty1-2,6-dimethylphenyl)- 1 ,Zdimesitylethene ( 4 ) was synthesized by irradiation of (4-tert-butyl-2,6-dimethylphenyl)mesitylketene 5. Ethene 4 exists in two diastereomeric forms ( E and Z ) , each existing as a racemate ( Le. , ( + ) / ( - ) 42 and ( + ) / ( - ) 4E ). The enantiomers were resolved by chiral HPLC and the EIZ diastereomers were separated by ( achiral ) supercritical fluid chromatography. The enantiomerization process which was studied in n-pentadecane has a barrier of AG* = 44.8 f 0.7 kcal mol-’. A 4 2 * 4E interconversion was not observed under the enantiomerization conditions. Consequently , we conclude that the threshold enantiomerization process of 4 does not involve a double bond rotation. A lower limit of 48.7 kcal mol- ’ is estimated for the barrier of the latter rotation .	0

Note in Table 1 ( entries 10 and 11 versus entries 7-9 ) that tricycloheptene 2b affords a much higher amount of bicycloheptadiene 5 compared to tricycloheptene 2a. In line with this observation , in the case of the phenyl quadricyclane 3b one obtains Sb besides 4b , which indicates that 3b(l)’+ and 3b(i)’+ have similiar energies. Therefore , the barrier between 3b(l)’+ and 3b(i)’+ has to be small , whereas between 3a(l)’+ and 3a(iY+ it appears to be large.

( R ' ) which then acts as a chain carrier by addition to the sulfur center of another molecule of starting compound ( Scheme 1 , reactions 1-3 ). However , in the presence of a radical trap X-Y ( Scheme 1 , reactions 4 and 5 ) , the quenching of R ' by X-Y results in the formation of R-X , the trapped product bearing a new functional group , and Y ' , a free radical capable of chain propagation by addition to the thiocarbonyl group of another molecule of precursor. For example , reductive decarboxylation occurs when X-Y is a tertiary thiol , introduction of a halogen atom takes place in the presence of Cl - CCl3 , Br - CBr3 , or I-CHG , and the use of disulfides , diselenides , and ditellurides as X-Y leads to the formation of thio- , seleno- and telluroethers , respectively ( see review by Crich9 ) .	0

In order to investigate the consequences of additional H2 loss from Re & (hq)(PPh3)2 and Re & (mq)(PPh & , we have begun a study of the reactions of these two compounds with various classes of organic molecules in the presence of H+ and other electrophiles which serve to remove H- and leave a coordina- tively unsaturated and reactive metal - containing cation. When an alkyne is used as the organic substrate , we find that a high yield route can be developed to afford a class of stable alkylidyne complexes of the type [ Re( = CCHzR)Hz(mq)- (PPh3)2]+. We have previously described5 some preliminary details of these reactions and now provide a full account of the scope of this chemistry , including the unusual finding that isomeric terminal and intemal alkynes with the same carbon skeleton give the exact same alkylidyne complexes. Synthetic and structural details are provided , along with information on the mechanisms of the contributing reactions .	0

A static chelate structure for 3 would possess diastereotopic Cp* groups and diastereotopic gem-methyl groups. Therefore , the observation of resonances for equivalent Cp* and gem- methyl groups in both the 'H and I3C NMR spectra at -100 OC suggests that a fluxional process interconverts the enanti- omers of 3. Dissociation of the chelated alkene to generate intermediate I ( Scheme 1 ) followed by recoordination of the opposite face of the alkene is the minimum process needed to interconvert both the gem-methyl groups and the Cp* groups. This rapid fluxional process is consistent with the expected weakness of a do metal - alkene interaction .	0

Formation of these hydrolysis products ( which are also generated by the reaction of 7 with DMD followed by aqueous acid ) points convincingly to the 43- epoxide structure 10 for the unstable intermediateI3 ( Scheme 2 ). In the same way , we showed that the labile byproduct formed along with 6 from the reaction of lophine with dilute ozone yielded benzil on treatment with dilute acid. With this evidence in hand , we suggest structure 11 for the lophine monooxygenated product .	0

Alternatively , 22 could be obtained directly from 18 by reduction , treatment with Amberlite resin , and finally acetylation. Hydroxylation of the trisubstituted olefin 22 with excess osmium tetraoxide , followed by acetylation , afforded the known euonyminol octaacetate 235 accompanied by its stereoisomer 24. The disappointing ratio of 2324 ( 19 ) may reflect an unfavorably directed osmylation in the heavily oxygenated milieu of 22 , in which case func- tionalization of the A334 bond could be effected earlier in the sequence. Nevertheless , methanolysis of 23 following Yama- da 's protocol6 gave (f)-euonyminol(2) , identical by comparison of chromatographic behavior and spectroscopic properties ( IR , 'H NMR , MS ) with the naturally derived material .	0

Abstract : A new method for the reductive cyclization of ynals involving a Ni(COD)2 / PBu3 catalyst system to produce allylic alcohols was developed. The triethylsilane - mediated procedure allows preparation of functionally rich pyrrolizidine , indolizidine , and quinolizidine alkaloid frameworks. The method allows the direct introduction of an allylic alcohol moiety with completely stereoselective creation of an exocyclic double bond and highly diastereoselective alcohol introduction relative to preexisting chirality. The total syntheses of (+)-allopumiliotoxin 267A , (+)-allopumiliotoxin 339A , and (+)-allopumiliotoxin 339B were accomplished utilizing an ynal cyclization as the key step. These syntheses provide short and efficient entries to the allopumiliotoxins and highlight the utility of nickel - catalyzed ynal cyclizations in complex synthetic strategies .	0

The selected enzyme for this study is a member of the prevalent nucleotidylyltransferase family responsible for the reversible conversion of R-D-glucopyranosyl phosphate ( Scheme 1a , 2 ) and NTP ( e.g. 1 ) to the corresponding NDP - sugar nucleotide ( 3 ) and pyrophosphate ( 4 ). Of the many nucleotidylyltransferases studied , the 3-forming thymidylyltransferases have received the least attention.6 The best characterized thymidylyltransferase ( Ep ) is from Salmonella in which substrate specificity studies were limited to only a few available hexopyranosyl phosphates.6a To extend these studies , we overexpressed the rmlA - encoded Ep in E. coli to provide the desired Ep as > 5 % of the total soluble protein.7 The corresponding Ep was purified to near homogeniety	0

the glycosylation of methyl 2,3,6-tri-0-benzoyl-a- ~ -glucopy- ranoside 1614 with 5-thioglucopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate 6 in the presence of triethylsilyl triflate. As observed for the glycosylations of the 4-OH acceptor 7 , the use of equimolar proportions of the donor 6 and the acceptor 16 , in glycosylation reactions , led to the isolation of significant quantities of the glucal 9 and low yields of the disaccharides.

In addition , the change in the magnitude of kr ( the chemical rate constant at low conversion as measured by competition '' with adamantyl- ideneadamantane ( k ~ = 3.49 x lo5 M-' s-')I2 ) as a function of [l] can be quantitatively predicted using Scheme 1 and the corresponding eq 2 ( inset in Figure 2 ).

Coupling of Aryl Iodides ( 19 ) , Organosilylstannanes ( 18 ) , and 1,3-Dienes ( 3 ) ( Eq 12 ). A typical reaction procedure is described for the synthesis of 4a. A mixture of 1,3-butadiene ( 3a ; 1.5 mmol , 0.94 mL of 1.6 M stock solution in toluene ) , Pd(DBA)z ( 14 mg , 0.025 mmol ) , 19a ( 102 mg , 0.5 mmol ) , 18a ( 181 mg , 0.5 mmol ) , toluene ( 2.0 mL ) , and a magnetic stirring bar were placed under argon flow in a 30 mL stainless autoclave containing an inserted glass liner. An air purge was confirmed by three pressurization (20-atm)-depressurization sequences with argon. After the reaction , the reaction mixture was treated with saturated ammonium fluoride solution to remove tributyltin iodide as insoluble tributyltin fluoride.

A colorless needle of I1 was obtained by slow evaporation of a MeOH solution under argon , and it was mounted on a Rigaku AFC6S diffractometer , at room temperature. The automatic centering and least - squares routines were carried out on 25 reflections in the 28 range 22.79 - 26.87' and corresponded to a monoclinic cell with a = 19.641 ( 4 ) , b = 21.636 ( 4 ) , c = 14.204 ( 3 ) A , p = 121.59(1)' , Z = 8 , V = 5141 ( 2 ) , space group C2k. The 0 - 2 8 data - collection technique was used , and data were collected ( 3.5 5 28 5 50 " ) at a scan speed of 8.0 " min-'. The structure was solved by direct methods. The nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by full - matrix least - squares technique. Hydrogen atoms were included at the calcu- lated positions. Of 4820 reflections collected , 1918 ( I 2 3a(I) ) were used in the refinement : R = 0.052 , R , = 0.64.

b. Electrochemical Measurements. Electrochemical stud- ies were performed using devices fabricated by solution casting the polymer of interest onto an array of two platinum inter- digitated microelectrodes having an interelectrode spacing of 10 pm. Cyclic voltammetry was performed by maintaining both electrodes at the same potential. Relative conductivity measure- ments were made by applying a small offset potential ( typically 20-50 mV ) between the two electrodes. In this configuration , the device behaves as a transistor and the drain current ( Id ) flowing between the electrodes is easily measured as a function of gate voltage ( Vg ). ’73’8 It is important to note that , because I d is directly proportional to the polymer ’s conductivity , measure- ments of the polymer ’s relative conductivity as a function of electrochemical potential can be easily obtained .	0

Although previous reports of the electrochemistry of 1,lO- phenanthroline-5,6-dione ( pdon ) in aqueous7 or semiaqueous solutions6 indicated that a reasonably well - behaved , two- electron , two - proton reversible electrode process is involved , we observed large deviations from this pattem when the reaction was inspected on time scales of a few seconds or less at pH values where the pyridine nitrogen sites were protonated. Under these conditions , the cathodic currents observed for the reduction of pdon were much smaller than the currents obtained at higher pH values where the nitrogen sites are not protonated. Coor-	0

Purification of the crude ozonolysis reaction mixture was accomplished by silica gel chromatography , which produced a mixture of interconverting alcohol products4 in -50 % yield. Since these compounds readily transformed to the ketoaldehyde 11 , they were acetylated , which improved their stability and allowed for a more thorough spectroscopic evaluation. The major product , 12 , could be purified and was stable in solution for several weeks. Unfortunately , NMR studies failed to give an unambiguous structure determination. Unequivocal structural assignment was ultimately secured through X-ray crystal- lographic analysis of a single crystal of 12. The X-ray structure of 12 is as represented in Scheme 2 .	0

9932 J. Am.. Chem. Soc. , Vol. 117 , No. 40 , 1995 properties , and potential applications derived therefrom. Be- cause of their delocalized electronic structure and relatively narrow band gap ( ca. 4 eV ) , polysilanes provide a new class of charge - transporting and photoconducting materials. They ex- hibit a strong near-W absorption that results from a-conjugation along the silicon backbone , and the radiation sensitivity associ- ated with this transition makes these polymers suitable for applications in microlithography. The primary synthetic route that has been used to explore polysilanes is the Wurtz - coupling of dichlorosilanes by alkali metal^.^ This method has proven very useful for research purposes , but it is severely limited as a general method since it produces moderate yields , and does not tolerate many functional groups .	0

A common feature of organolithium phosphorus(V) com- pounds containing P-X ( X = N , 0 , S ) groups is the lack of a carbon-lithium bond , a situation similar to that found in In this paper we monometalated sulfoxidesI6 and s u l f o n e ~ . ~ ~ ~ , ~ ~ report the first single - crystal X-ray and solution structure of a lithium monophosphazenyl derivative showing the existence of a nitrogen- and a carbon-lithium bond. These results are compared with the theoretical structure obtained by MNDO calculations. The X-ray analysis has been carried out on crystals formed in a THF solution. The solution structure has been derived from a multinuclear NMR study ( IH , 6Li , I3C , 15N , and 3'P ) , including several combinations of triple resonance experi- ments. The effect of metalation of la on several NMR parameters is discussed in terms of changes in geometry and charge distribution versus the parent compound , and the results are in good agreement with those expected from the computed structure. The stability of the ring formed between the bidentate phosphazenyl ligand and the lithium was analyzed according to the MNDO method .	0
Product Studies. The photosensitized oxidation of the azoalkanes results in efficient deazatization affording N and Q as the major products with each of the sensitizers employed ( Table 1 ). Steady - state photolysis ( A > 370 nm ) of acetonitrile solutions of DCA or TCA in the presence of Azo-Q affords N in virtually quantitative yield at 2-50 % conversion of Azo-Q ; the valence isomer Q was not detected. Irradiation of DCA or TCA,in the presence of Azo-N affords N ( 18 % ) and Q ( 82 % ) as the sole products ( eq 3 ) .	0

Abstract : The series of new bis(tetrathiafulva1ene) [bis(TTF)] compounds 10-12a,b have been synthetized with the TTF - like synthon 8a,b , previously used to prepare the pyrazine - fused bis( " F ) 7a,b. These compounds exhibit four reversible sequential one - electron oxidation steps , on the basis of cyclic voltammetry. For the cation radicals 7W+ , lo'+ , and 12'+ , generated electrochemically , rather intense and broad bands in the near-IR region , specific of class 11 mixed valence compounds , were found. Theoretical calculations at the semiempirical AM1 level as well as at the ab - initio level indicated that these cation radicals are charge - distributions localized as related to mixed valence species. These calculations also allowed the low - energy absorption bands to be assigned to intervalence transitions ; these transitions imply the existence of multiple low - lying excited states that are non-adiabatically coupled to the ground - state of these open - shell species .	0

In this paper we report the synthesis , structure , and electrical property measurements of the new ternary tellurides Hf5MTe3 ( M = Fe , Co ). A structural comparison of these new com- pounds with the previously reported HfsMTe6 materials and new results concerning the latter compounds are also presented. The results of band structure calculations serve to aid in the analysis of structural features and electronic properties .	0
J. Am. Chem. Soc. , Vol. I1 7 , No. 40 , I995 10043 proximate amount of ethylene dissolved , the yield of the reaction of 1 with ethylene sulfide at concentrations similar to those utilized in the competition experiments was determined. The yield of sulfido complex 2 was found to be 98 % by 'H NMR spectroscopy , while the yield of 'H NMR detectable ethylene was only 40 % . Therefore , the amount of ethylene produced in the competition reactions was assumed to be approximately double the value observed. The effect of added alkene on the product ratio in the competition reactions was examined. In experiment no. 2 of Table 5 propene ( 0.72 x mol ) was introduced into the reaction mixture before the addition of imido complex 1. The product ratio was found to be the same as for the reaction without added propene ( experiment no. 1 , Table 5 ) within experimental error .	0

With enantiopure monoazide 6 in hand , the stage was set for regio- and diastereocontrolled introduction of the aryl group by S N ~ ' chemistry via organocuprates. All attempts to preform the organocuprate led to disappointing results , which we attributed to the instability of the arylcuprate. On the other hand , addition of the Grignard reagent 91 ° to a mixture of the azide 6 and cuprous cyanide gave reproducibly the desired adduct 10 , for which the vicinal coupling J a b = 10 HZ ( 6 , 3.10 , 6 b 3.36 ) confirms the regio- and diastereochemistry. Difficulty associ- ated with purification of 10 led to its immediate cis-dyhy- droxylation to give 118 in 62 % overall yield from 6. The NMR coupling constants fully confirm the assigned regio- and stereochemistry ( 6 , 2.83 , 6b 3.51 , 6 , 4.01 , J a b = 12 HZ , Jac = 10.3 Hz ) .	0

Howard Hughes Medical Institute Department of Chemistry , University of Califomia Berkeley , Colifomia 94720 Receiued June 15 , 1995 Recently , a number of strategies have been developed for isolating RNAs with novel catalytic activities from large libraries of random RNA sequences.' One such approach involves screening random pools of RNAs for molecules that bind an analogue of the transition state ( TS3 for the reaction of interest. By in uitro screening of RNAs for their ability to bind the planar TS* analogue 4 , a 165 nucleotide ( nt ) RNA ( AA6 ) was isolated that catalyzes the isomerization reaction of the diastereomeric biphenyl 1 to its isomer 2. with kat = 2.8 x min-l and K , = 542 pM ( Scheme 1 ) ; the reaction was competitively inhibited by 5 , with an inhibition constant ( Ki ) of 7 pM ? In an effort to gain greater insight into the nature of this RNA- catalyzed reaction , we have carried out a series of chemical and enzymatic modification experiments as well as a mutational analysis of this RNA .	0

An intriguing biosynthetic question relates to the timing of the dimerization step. In principle , several scenarios can be envisaged. The first of these postulates processing a single precursor steroid via selective oxidations to individual “ North ” and “ South ” a-amino ketones 9 and 10 which undergo dimer- ization to the unsymmetrical pyrazine cephalostatin 7 .( 12 ). 2 A consequence of this mechanistic variant is the expectation that the C2 symmetrical dimers cephalostatin 126 ( 11 ) and the recently discovered ritterazine K (13)3b would also be formed ( Scheme 1 ). While one would expect a 1 : 2 : 1 ratio of 11 : 12 : 13 to be formed if precursors 9 and 10 were present at the same concentration and if dimerization rates for all a-amino ketones were approximately the same , it is clear that isolation of 11 and 12 to the virtual exclusion of 13 would occur if the “ North spiroketal ” precursor 9 was present in substantially greater concentration. Such a picture is consistent with the fact that the “ North spiroketal ” appears in most of the 15 known cephalostatins isolated from C. gilchristi and is also in accord with the finding that cephalostatin 7 ( 12 ) is isolated in 10-fold lower yields than cephalostatin 12 ( 11 ). 2 $ 6	0
The 13C NMR signals ( Table 1 ) for the sp2 carbons of 2 in CD2Cl2 ( ( cid : 228 ) 175.9 , 153.2 , 149.7 ppm ) showed downfield shifts compared with 4 ( ( cid : 228 ) 152.0 , 145.5 , 141.8 ) , indicating considerable positive - charge delocalization in the seven - membered ring. The most downfield - shifted signal ( ( cid : 228 ) 175.9 ) is assigned to the ( cid : 226)-carbon judging from the calculated chemical shifts for 1 ( R , 136.5 ; ( cid : 226 ) , 167.6 ; ( cid : 231 ) , 141.0 ). 18 These results imply that a contribution of the sila-allylic resonance structure is important for the positive - charge delocalization .	0
4. Trapping with H Atom Donors. To further clarify the nature of the process that leads to the parent amine 5e , a series of chemical trapping experiments were carried out. Triphenyl- methane ( Ph3CH , a H atom donoso ) was used as the trapping agent. Two possibilities were considered. First , the singlet nitrenium ion could abstract a hydride. This would give the triphenylmethyl cation which , after reaction with residual water , would result in triphenylmethanol. Second , H atom transfer to the triplet nitrenium ion would result in the triphenylmethyl radical ( Ph3c ' ). The latter would dimerize to give the Ullman hydrocarbon 12 .	0

Although abundant fullerenes such as Ca and C70 have been well characterized , in both the gas and condensed phases , not much is known about carbon clusters containing 100-1000 atoms. Recent electron microscope and scanning tunneling microscope studies of various types of carbon soot have revealed the presence of unusual nanostructures such as nested fullerenesl and a variety of nanotube ~ . ~ . ~ However , the nature of the structural evolution that occurs between fullerenes and these large carbon nanostructures remains unexplored. There is some evidence from gas - phase experiments for the existence of giant fullerenes. Carbon clusters containing up to several hundred atoms have been formed by pulsed laser vaporization and examined by mass ~ pectrometry.4- ~ Carbon clusters ( presumably fullerenes ) with masses greater than 3000 amu have been observed in laser desorption mass spectrometry investigations of arc - generated soot extract.6 In addition , scanning tunneling microscope images of the extract obtained by high - pressure and high - temperature bomb extraction of arc generated soot show roughly spherical structures , 1-2 nm in diameter , which may be fullerenes containing up to 330 atoms7 Transmission electron microscope images of much larger carbon clusters ( containing several thousand atoms ) suggest that these species can exist as nested fullerene cage structures , called bucky- onions.'

This landmark achievement has become a prototype for other membrane anchors , and as a result of these investigations the general structural pattern depicted in Figure 1 has begun to emerge.5 Thus the highlighted penta- saccharide core is conserved throughout the evolutionary scale from bacteria to mammals. The latter is exemplified in the rat brain Thy-1 glycoprotein anchor 2 ( Scheme 1 ) with two ethanolamines , one free while the other links the anchor to cysteine , the carboxy terminal residue of the protein :	0

The acetogenins are a class of potent bioactive compounds found in various plant species in the Annonaceae.' Motivated by their promising potential as new antitumor drugs,' we have now investigated the bioactive leaves of Rollinia mucosa ( Jacq. ) Baill. ( Annonaceae ). Some initial results have been reported elsewhere.2 Herein , we report the isolation , absolute structure determination , and bioactivity of mucocin ( 1 , Figure 1 ). The previously known acetogenins are usually characterized ( among other features ) by their bearing one to three tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) rings.' 1 is the first annonaceous acetogenin to be reported that bears a hydroxylated tetrahydropyran ( THP ) ring along with a THF ring. This finding adds a new skeletal type to the family of annonaceous acetogenins .	0

Ab Initio Calculations. The rate studies implicating transition structures with stoichiometry [(n-BuLi)2(TMEDA)2(Ar-H)]q suggest a commonality of mechanism despite the diversity of substituents. We will invoke lithiations via TMEDA - solvated triple ion 13 , illustrated generically in eqs 4 and 5 ( and elaborated in Scheme 1 in the Discussion section ). We investigated the reaction coordinate computationally to under- stand the substituent - dependent rates and the efficacy of the triple ion - based model. Unfortunately , MNDO calculations are inadequate for severely congested systems.45 Moreover , pre-	0
Azodioxide 2 gives a CV portrait very similar to that observed for 1 but shifted to slightly lower potentials. Both 2'+ and 2m'+ have solution lifetimes less than milliseconds at room temper- ature as indicated by the chemically irreversible nature of the oxidation waves. Analogous to 1's anodic oxidation dynamics , it appears that monomer 2m forms from 2'+ under CV conditions because the second oxidation wave is always observed , even from colorless solutions of 2 at low temperatures which must contain very little 2m. The CV - derived anodic peak potentials for 1 and 2 ( and for lm and 2m ) are listed in Table 3 .	0
