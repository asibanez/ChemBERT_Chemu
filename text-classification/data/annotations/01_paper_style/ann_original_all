Extension of the central π-electron unit from a thienoquinoid unit to a thienothienoquinoid unit caused a huge red shift of 44 nm for 2a in contrast to that of 1a due to narrowing of the HOMO − LUMO gap through the extension of π-conjugation.

The trend for the K1 values ( Table 1 ) shows a general preference for more charge- dense / basic halides as the bond acceptor ( Cl− > Br− > I− ) , which allows for a stronger electrostatic as well as charge- transfer interaction. Nevertheless , the soft halides are also strongly bound , which is tentatively assigned to a larger covalent contribution toward the halogen bond interactions compared to that of the analogous hydrogen bond systems.29,33 In comparison to the halides , the complexation of acetate , dihydrogen phosphate , and sulfate is much stronger , which was also found previously in analogous studies43 and is rationalized by the higher basicity of the selected oxo-anions. The observed slight preference for dihydrogen phosphate over acetate is contrary to the higher charge density and basicity of acetate and is thus ascribed to a better ﬁt between the receptor ’s cavity and the tetrahedral anion.

Further , constants the atoms involved.13,14 Since the coupling constant is a physical parameter that is expressed as a function of the electronic distribution within the molecule it will also reﬂect diﬀerences in the electronic structure brought about by the presence of diﬀerent substituents. This correlation can be expressed as a linear free energy relationship in the same manner as in eq 1. It is important that the change of the physical parameter that is monitored is convincingly large when constructing Hammett plots.

For 3-BDP and 4-BDP , both absorption and emission maxima and ﬂuorescence quantum yields are identical to those for the corresponding benchmark monomers , which suggests that there is a negligible conjugation between chlorin and BODIPY , which , in turn , may lead to an attenuation of photoinduced electron transfer. However , further systematic time - resolved spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of quenching of ﬂuorescence for chlorin components in arrays. In order to further evaluate the applicability of amide - linked BODIPY − chlorin dyads for bioimaging , we compared the quantum yields of ﬂuorescence for the chlorin component in arrays upon excitation at the BODIPY absorption , in various solvents ( toluene , MeOH , DMSO , DMF ; Table S1 , Supporting Information ). The data show that the dyads 3-BDP , 4-BDP , and Zn4 - BDP retain relatively high ﬂuorescence quantum yields in solvents of diﬀerent polarities. Fluorescence for these arrays is comparable in toluene , DMF , and DMSO , and modestly reduced in MeOH ( on average ﬂuorescence quantum yields in MeOH are 0.71-fold of that in toluene ). Finally , we compared the ﬂuorescence intensity for dyads vs monomers upon excitation at ∼ 500 nm , at the same concentration.

Among them , DABCO showed a positive eﬀect in raising the yields of both 4a and 5a ( entry 4 ). Next , inspired by the fact that pivalic acid ( PivOH ) has frequently been used as an additive to facilitate Cu - catalyzed coupling reactions,17 we tried PivOH in the reaction of 1a , 2a , and 3. As expected , addition of PivOH did indeed improve the reaction , but the yields were still not satisfactory ( entry 5 ).

A strategy to eliminate the catalyst involves preactivation of the reagents , by using , for example , strained alkynes in the reaction.5 Coupling reactions that involve activated azides are less studied.6 One example involves the thioacid / azide amidation reaction , ﬁrst discovered in the 1980s,7 and reinvestigated in the past decade.8 Various azides can react with thiocarboxylic acids ( −CSOH or −COSH ) to form amide bonds while releasing nitrogen gas and elemental sulfur. Azides having electron - withdrawing groups generally display kinetics considerably faster than those of their electron- rich counterparts. This is in contrast to Staudinger ligation and azide − alkyne cycloaddition , where electron - rich azides show higher the thioacid-azide reaction has been proposed to proceed by stepwise nucleophilic addition to give intermediate I , followed by cyclization to thiotriazoline intermediate ( II ) , and ﬁnal extrusion of N2S to give the amide product ( Scheme 1 ). 8b","2, 3, 18, 19, 21, 22, 116, 117, 125, 126, 133, 134, 135, 136, 151, 152, 158, 159, 164, 165, 173, 174, 199, 200, 208, 209, 212, 213, 232, 233, 246, 247",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

It implied that the CH − π interaction between the Cp* group of the catalyst and the ester function of the β-substrate is too weak to stabilize the transition state , thus leading to poor enantioselectivity for short - chain aliphatic substrates. However , the strong hydrophobic inter- action between the long alkyl chain of the substrate and the aliphatic tail of the catalyst in the metallomicelle core may greatly improve the stability of the catalytic transition state ( Figure 5 ) , resulting in high enantioselectivities in thus long - chain aliphatic β-ketoesters ( 86 − 91 % ee , reduction of Table 2 , entry 9 − 12 ). It is also consistent with the observation that poor enantioselectivity ( 11 % ee , Table 2 , entry 13 ) was obtained for long - chain aliphatic β-ketoester substrates using Rh - TsDPEN catalyst due to lack of strong hydrophobic attraction in the transition state. In the case of aliphatic γ- ketoesters , we propose that the aliphatic γ-ketoesters may have the same mechanism as β-ketoesters. We also investigated the mechanism of aliphatic ketoesters bearing acetyl ketone group ( 21−29a ). We propose that the absolute conﬁgurations was controlled with a similar mecha- nism as that of aliphatic ketones ( SI Figure S8),10b but the ester group of the substrate may have some interaction with the catalyst playing a negative role on the transition state , which could be explained by the phenomena that decreasing the space of to lower enantioselectivity ( Table 3 entries 1 − 5 ).

To rule out the possibility that the coupling reaction was initiated by deprotonation at the α- position of the α-silylamine , we labeled N-phenyl α-silylamine with deuterium on the α-carbon ( d-1a ) and coupled it to the imine 2a to aﬀord the vicinal diamine d-3a or the N-silyl diamine d-4a with the deuterium intact ( eq 3 ).

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00348-0,"ABSTRACT : This paper demonstrates the role of solvent in selectivity and sensitivity of a series of electron - rich compounds for the detection of trace amounts of picric acid. Two new electron - rich ﬂuorescent esters ( 6 , 7 ) containing a triphenylamine backbone as well as their analogous carboxylic acids ( 8 , 9 ) have been synthesized and characterized. Fluorescent triphenylamine coupled with an ethynyl moiety constitutes π-electron - rich selective and sensitive probes for electron - deﬁcient picric acid ( PA ). the high sensitivity of all the sensors toward PA can be attributed to a combined eﬀect of the ground - state charge - transfer complex formation and resonance energy transfer between the sensor and analyte. The acids 8 and 9 also showed enhanced sensitivity for nitroaromatics in the solid state , and their enhanced sensitivity could be attributed to exciton migration due to close proximity of the neighboring acid molecules , as evident from the X-ray diﬀraction study. The compounds were found to be quite sensitive for the detection of trace amount of nitroaromatics in solution , solid , and contact mode .","36, 37, 44, 45, 64, 65, 68, 69",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

The conformational preference of the arabinosyl oxocarbenium ions ( 45 − 47 ) is less profound than the preference of the corresponding ribo-oxocarbenium ions ( 42 − 44 ). This may be due to the fact that the C2 and C3 substituents can not simultaneously adopt their most favorable orientation in either of the envelope structures. As is the case of the ribofuranosyl oxocarbenium ions , the FES maps for the ion 46 are somewhat methyl-substituted arabinofuranosyl steeper than for the aldose ion 45 , while the maps for the phenyl-substituted arabinofuranosyl ion 47 are somewhat less steep.

Oct-2-ynal and 3-(trimethylsilyl)propioaldehyde were success- fully used in the MCR ( 5b and 5c ) ( Table 2 , entry 1 ). However , during the cyclization step , the optimized conditions previously found provided only starting material. Heating the reaction or increasing the reaction time favored only degradation without leading to the formation of the expected cyclized product. Our electrophilic cyclization using iodine is therefore restricted to aromatic ethynyl derivatives. In view of the lack of other easily available unsaturated aldehydes , we decided to examine the potent ability of N-tert-butyl-6-chloro-2-[2-(trimethylsilyl)- ethylnyl]imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-amine 5c to act as a useful precursor. recently reported a Sonogashira reaction on pyridylethynyltrimethylsilyl deriva- tives.12 Their experimental conditions were attempted on our substrate , and we were pleased to isolate 5q and 5r in good yield ( Scheme 4 ).

The protocol is modular and opera- tionally convenient. The ortho-alkoxybenzaldehyde products can be converted in one additional step to ortho-alkoxystyrenes by a Wittig reaction. These styrenes are precursors to the chelating benzylidene moiety in a proposed series of novel ruthenium complexes for use in oleﬁn metathesis. Chelation with three representative styrenes has been demonstrated .,"12, 13, 23, 24, 24, 25, 35, 36, 45, 46, 51, 52, 57, 58, 65, 66, 70, 71, 76, 77",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

The synthesis of this key intermediate would come from coupling a C5 - activated cyanoimidazole 3 with the known bromopyrrole 4.14 Despite the lack of solid precedent for amidine electrocyclizations of this type , we felt that the ease of many electrocyclizations,15 coupled with the potential for multiple conditions to mediate this key cyclization , supported the exploration of this strategy. Herein we describe the realization of this approach and the development of a Ni- mediated cyclization , which enabled the eﬃcient construction of this highly functionalized pyrrolopyridine in just 8 steps and 29 % overall yield.16 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In order to evaluate the proposed 6π-electrocyclization , it was necessary to synthesize the pyrrole − imidazole 7 ( Scheme 1 ). We proposed to accomplish this via a Suzuki coupling , starting from the C4 - brominated pyrrole 4. Preparation of the known 4- bromopyrrole 4 was accomplished in two steps from trichloroacetylpyrrole,17 which was followed by N-ethylation to give the N-ethylpyrrole 5 ( Scheme 1 ). The borylation of electron - rich heteroaromatic compounds can be diﬃcult due to the general the resulting electron - rich boronates ; 18 indeed , the formation of pyrrole 6 proved challenging. Initial screening results indicated that a combina- tion of KOAc / Pd(OAc)2 / Cy3P in toluene was capable of giving high yields of the desired boronate 6 ( > 95 % conversion with ∼ 99 : 1 selectivity for Miyaura borylation over proto-dehaloge- nation ).

The emission spectrum of 1 is well resolved in hexane solution , but is broad and featureless in THF and MeCN solutions with a solvatochromic shift of up to 1920 cm−1 , indicating that the emission is from a π − π* state in a nonpolar environment and from a state of greater charge- transfer character in more polar solvents. In contrast , the emission of 2 is more weakly solvatochromic , shifting only 330 cm−1 from hexane to MeCN solutions. It exhibits sharp , well- resolved emission in all three solvents with an average vibrational spacing between the most prominent bands of ca. 1350 cm−1 ( assigned to an average of aromatic ring vibrational modes ) , and thus a pure π − π* description is appropriate for the emission in all solvents studied. This is also revealed by its long pure - radiative lifetime , τ 0 , in hexane solution of 140 ns. The emission of 3 is similar to that of 1 , albeit slightly red- shifted ( 530 cm−1 in hexane solution ) and with an increased maximum solvatochromic shift of 2100 cm−1.

Importantly , these conditions negated the use of additional ligands or organic solvents , rendering the process operationally simple ; the reaction could also be carried out in air.

Low conversion was also observed when the reaction was carried out in wet THF ( entry 5 ) , and only trace product was observed in anhydrous THF ( entry 6 ).

The scope has been explicitly investigated to demonstrate the eﬀect of diﬀerent substitutions on the outcome of the set of compounds wherein the pyrazole ring does not bear any substitution under low quantities of TFA / TFAA ( 9 : 1 , v / v ) mixture ( higher substrate concentration ) aﬀorded the biaryl bis-pyrazoles via dehydrogenative homocoupling exclusively. However , resulted in the ( o- hydroxyphenyl)pyrazoles as the major products when the identical reaction was performed in the presence of an increased quantity of TFA / TFAA ( 9 : 1 , v / v ) mixture ( low substrate concentration ). Further , if the phenyl ring carried an ortho-substituent then monohy- droxylation took place but if both the ortho-positions were free then bis-hydroxylation prevailed under the conditions. Unlike in the set of compounds where the pyrazole ring carried the carboxylate group at the 3-position , in most of the cases a mixture of biaryl bis-pyrazoles and (o-hydroxyphenyl)- pyrazoles were formed under higher substrate concentration , but (o-hydroxyphenyl)pyrazoles were isolated in superior yields when the concentration of the starting material was low. In addition for these starting substrates , the protocol worked only when both ortho-positions of the phenyl ring were free since all compounds bearing an ortho-substituted phenyl the pyrazole substrates bearing a carboxylate group at the C-5 or C-4 position , mostly biaryl bis-pyrazoles were isolated. Interestingly , for the pyrazoles bearing a phenyl group at the C-3 position in place of the carboxylate group at lower substrate concentration we could isolate only the ( o- hydroxyphenyl)pyrazole with no trace of biaryl bis-pyrazoles.

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00742-0,"ABSTRACT : Invader probes have been proposed as alternatives to polyamides , triplex - forming oligonucleotides , and peptide nucleic acids for recognition of chromosomal DNA targets. These double- stranded probes are activated for DNA recognition by + 1 interstrand zippers of pyrene - functionalized nucleotides. This particular motif forces the intercalating pyrene moieties into the same region , resulting in perturbation and destabilization of the probe duplex. In contrast , the two probe strands display very high aﬃnity toward complementary DNA. The energy diﬀerence between the probe duplexes and recognition complexes provides the driving force for DNA recognition. In the present study , we explore the properties of Invader probes based on larger intercalators , i.e. , perylene and coronene , expecting that the larger π-surface area will result in additional destabilization of the probe duplex and further stabilization of probe − target duplexes , in eﬀect increasing the thermodynamic driving force for DNA recognition. Toward this end , we developed protocols for 2′-N-methyl-2′-amino-2′- deoxyuridine phosphoramidites that are functionalized at the N2′ - position with pyrene , perylene , or coronene moieties and incorporated these monomers into oligodeoxyribonucleotides ( ONs ).

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00787-0,"ABSTRACT : A series of thienylphenothiazine decorated carbazoles were synthesized and characterized by optical , electrochemical , thermal , and theoretical investigations. Ab- sorption spectra of the compounds are inﬂuenced by the substitution pattern and chromophore number density. Compounds containing 2,7-substitution exhibited red - shifted absorption , while the chromophore loading on the other positions led to the increment in molar extinction coeﬃcients due to the increase in the chromophore density. Multiple substitutions resulted in twisting of chromophores and aﬀected the π-electrons , which the conjugative delocalization of produced shorter wavelength absorption for the 2,3,6,7- tetrasubstituted derivative. the compounds exhibited excited - state solvatochromism attributable to the structural reorganization - induced electronic perturbations. The solvatochromic data are supportive of a general solvent eﬀect , which is further conﬁrmed by Lippert − Mataga correlation. End- capping with butterﬂy shaped phenothiazine restrained the formation of molecular aggregates in the solid state. All of the compounds displayed exceptional thermal stability attributable to the rigid carbazole building block.

Indeed , 1 is freely soluble in water , and therefore , no formulation of 1 is required for downstream imaging and toxicity studies. An 19F NMR study on an aqueous solution of amphiphile 1 was then carried out ( Figure 2 ). As expected , 1 gave a sharp singlet 19F NMR peak in deuterated chloroform from its 48 symmetrical ﬂuorines. However , only a weak 19F NMR signal was detected from its aqueous solution. Such a phenomenon is usually an indication of short relaxation times , which can “ turn oﬀ ” the 19F NMR signal.11 In fact , a transverse relaxation time of 1 ( T2 = 4.7 ms ; see short Supporting Information , Figure S1 ) in water was found. There are a few reports on the self - assembly of amphiphilic conjugated π-molecules in water where π-stacking and hydrophobic interactions are the driving forces.12 Therefore , the short T2 of 1 is probably a result of its self - assembly into supermolecular structures. To “ turn on ” the 19F NMR signal , it is necessary to tune the self - assembly by modifying the chemical two strategies were employed to tune the self - assembly : ( 1 ) breaking the molecular coplanarity by hydrogenation of the triple bonds in 1 to relieve the π-stacking and ( 2 ) increasing the hydrophilicity of 1 by introducing additional PEG units .","11, 12, 53, 54, 79, 80, 95, 96, 123, 124, 203, 204, 262, 263",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Type I alkenes undergo rapid homodimerization , and these can participate in an ensuing CM event. Type II alkenes undergo slow homodimerization leading to homodimers that can participate in CM to a limited extent. Type III alkenes do not form homodimers , but they are able to react with type I and II homodimers in a CM.

Near-IR emission of 02('A,) - formed upon sensitization by 3 under both steady - state irradiation and pulsed excitation - constitutes the first direct evidence for the intersystem crossing of a bilatriene. The low photooxidation yield results from a low intersystem crossing < IO4 , estimated by the energy - transfer method in flash photolysis. A total rate constant of k = ( 3.4 f yield from 3 , 0.3 ) X 108 M-' s-' was determined for the quenching of 02 ( 1 $ ) by 3.

The wavelength dependence of the self - sensitized photooxidation of 3 is due to the selective reaction of the helical conformer , while a selective photoisomerization of the stretched forms of 3 and 5 was observed by time - resolved laser - induced optoacoustic spectroscopy.

Several model dienes ( sa-5f ) have been designed to enhance the facial selectivity at room temperature. The design concept of these dienes is based on our proposed perpendicular model ( Siegel , C. ; Thornton , E. R Tetrahedron Lett. 1988 , 29 , 5225-5228 ) , which we used to rationalize the diastereofacial preference observed with diene 1. Our approach to increasing the diastereoselectivity was to enhance the population of the preferred diene rotamer in the ground state as well as in the transition structure. From X-ray structures of the cycloadducts and the reversal of facial selectivity with dienes having a free hydroxy group at the chiral center , we conclude that dieneilienophile coordination through hydrogen bonding plays an important role in promoting chirality transfer. We postulate that facial selectivity is controlled by a balance of two competing forces ( stereoelectronics vs hydrogen bonding ) on the diene conformation in the transition structure. Conformational tuning at the stereogenic center helped in designing a diene ( Se ) , which aims at maximizing the hydrogen - bonding interaction by decreasing the stereoelectronic preference.

CO is found to bind to the CuCI( 1 1 1 ) surface nondissociatively with its molecular axis normal to the surface and with a high heat of adsorption of 23 * 2 kcal / mol , similar to that of CO on Cu / ZnO. Variable photon energy photoelectron spectroscopy ( PES ) has been used to investigate the nature of this bonding and to compare this to CO bonding to the coordinatively unsaturated Zn(I1) site on ZnO(lOT0 ). CO binding to CuCl is found to induce a shift of Cu 3d , levels to deeper binding energy and to result in the presence of intense CO core level satellites , both results indicating the presence of A back - bonding of intermediate strength , which is not found to be present for CO bonding to ZnO.

10.1021/ja00022a033-0,"For the middle and later first row transition metals , chromium to copper , the number and variety of high - valent and / or strongly oxidizing complexes are limited by the small range of compatible ligands. Two properties of ligand complements are especially important in determining the compatibility : ( i ) the donor capacity , since strong donor ligands reduce the oxidizing properties of high - valent complexes and ( ii ) the ability of the ligand complement to resist oxidative destruction , since strongly oxidizing metal centers tend to rapidly degrade oxidatively sensitive ligands. Significant advantages can ensue from the development of ligand complements which have a high donor capacity combined with superior resistance to oxidative destruction. Such ligands have allowed for the isolation and study of analogues of more reactive and elusive putative intermediates in catalytic homogeneous ox- idations.2 Long - lived homogeneous catalysts3 have been developed with ligand complements that are resistant to oxidation but not strongly donating. In this report , we present the synthesis of a series of tetraamide macrocycles ( H4[ 11-H4[3] ) which have been designed to afford strongly donating tetraamido-N ligands upon tetradeprotonation and to be resistant to oxidative destruction.

Thus , 9 and 10 , which have shorter B-P bonds than that in 8 , have lower rotation barriers probably because of different excited - state structures.

We use two structurally complementary ł(2) - active chromophores that can be deposited with orientational control relative to the substrate. These chromophores produce multilayer ł(2) responses identical in magnitude but of opposite sign. We form opposing bilayers with these chromophores to produce two different structural motifs , each with a local center of inversion about the ZP interlayer bonding plane. The ł(2) responses of these two bilayer systems are different and reveal the extent to which the dipole approximation is valid in these layered assemblies. Our data elucidate the role that quadrupolar terms play in the ł(2) responses of thin interfacial films. This work illustrates the complex and subtle structural issues associated with the design and construction of layered interfaces and provides a means to evaluate the vacancy and orientational defect density in layered materials .","12, 13, 14, 15",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

In this interpretation a triplet carbene can react with pyridine to form an ylide via a singlet - triplet surface crossing along the reaction coordinate. The surface crossing mechanism resolves inconsis- tencies in the kinetics of reaction of triplet diphenylcarbene and methanol. The data of this work is consistent with either a preequilibrium or surface crossing mechanism.

While the distortion of the trans-axial ligand does not significantly affect the C0-0 , linkage , as judged by the constancy of the inherent frequency of u ( o .

The motif is based on the hydrogen bonding complementarity of carboxylic acids with 2-aminopyridine derivatives. Linking two aminopyridine groups through a rigid aromatic spacer provides a receptor unit that can complex dicarboxylic acids. When there is a good correspondence between the length of the spacer and that of the carboxylic acid , a discrete 1 : l complex is formed. When the dicarboxylic acid is longer than the receptor , an alternating hydrogen - bonded cocrystal occurs with the carboxylates on each diacid binding to different receptors. This motif dominates the cocrystal , forming even when the relative lengths of the diacid and the receptor change. Within the constraints of the alternating ribbon structure , the spatial position of the two components can be varied in a well - defined and predictable manner .","4, 5, 25, 26, 32, 33, 36, 37, 91, 92, 98, 99, 101, 102, 120, 121",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

We first ex- amined the enolate alkylation of a-methyl-substituted oxazinone 3a ( R = Me ) by employing method A ( Le. , enolate generation followed by electrophilic quenching ). Unfortunately , the ho- mologated products 7 were not detected. Even when potassium bis(trimethylsily1)amide and allyl iodide were used , none of the desired product 7 could be detected ; only decomposition of the starting material was observed. By employing the protocol de- scribed above ( method B ) involving addition of the base to a mixture of oxazinone containing the electrophile , the enolate alkylations of the a-methyl-substituted oxazinones 3a were re- alized , as shown in Scheme 111. First , sodium bis(trimethy1- silyl)amide was examined to determine whether it was reactive enough for the second alkylation. To a solution of 3a ( R = Me ) and allyl iodide in T H F / H M P A was added sodium bis(tri- methy1silyl)amide at -78 O C .

10.1021/ja00024a038-6,"B. Synthesis of a,a - Disubstituted Amino Acids. We first ex- amined the enolate alkylation of a-methyl-substituted oxazinone 3a ( R = Me ) by employing method A ( Le. , enolate generation followed by electrophilic quenching ). Unfortunately , the ho- mologated products 7 were not detected. Even when potassium bis(trimethylsily1)amide and allyl iodide were used , none of the desired product 7 could be detected ; only decomposition of the starting material was observed. By employing the protocol de- scribed above ( method B ) involving addition of the base to a mixture of oxazinone containing the electrophile , the enolate alkylations of the a-methyl-substituted oxazinones 3a were re- alized , as shown in Scheme 111. First , sodium bis(trimethy1- silyl)amide was examined to determine whether it was reactive enough for the second alkylation. To a solution of 3a ( R = Me ) and allyl iodide in T H F / H M P A was added sodium bis(tri- methy1silyl)amide at -78 O C . The homologated oxazinone 7s ( R , = Me , R2 = allyl ) was detected only in trace amounts by TLC.

This result indicates that the side chain attached to the dansyl ring is recognized by the hydrophobic subsite ' of antibody 2 and significantly contributes to the antigen binding. A transferred nuclear Overhauser effect ( TRNOE ) measurement4 has confirmed that the lysine side chain is folded when compound 1 is bound to antibody 2. On the basis of these results , attempts were made to use the hydrophobic subsife of antibody 2 as a chiral auxiliary for stereoselective organic reactions.

10.1021/ja00025a008-0,"Abstract : ESR experiments on an X-irradiated single crystal of enantiomerically pure bis(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)phosphinic chloride ( Ar,P(O)CI ) reveal the formation of the corresponding phosphoryl radical ( la , Ar2PO ) via a dissociative electron - capture reaction of the PCI bond. At 120 K , this radical exhibits an exclusive and enantioselective stereoinversion in the single - crystal matrix leading to the phosphoryl radical structure lb. This process was monitored in detail using anisotropic ESR spectroscopy combined with X-ray crystallographic data. An analysis of the nonbonded steric interactions demonstrates that the stereoinversion is controlled intramolecularly and occurs in a synchronous reorientation of the PO bond and two methyl groups of the ortho tert-butyl substituents. Besides the stereoinversion , other radical reactions are observed in the crystal matrix. Ab initio quantum chcmical calculations are employed to assess the electronic structure of the phosphoryl radical in more detail. An ROHF / 6-31G* gcomctry optimization within C , symmetry constraints yields two equilibrium structures which basically differ by their PO bond length ( 1.478 and 1.616 A ).

Another unfavorable conformation results if the ring twists about the double bond , perturbing the a system. The lowest energy conformations result from a ring - bending , which gives rise to a boat structure , and from a ring - twisting , which gives rise to a half - chair form.

With X = I , the ' self - exchange "" process is sufficiently rapid in alcohol solvents to lead to epimerization of the norbornyl iodide starting material.26 Studies of alkyl radical / alkyl halide transfer in benzene suggest transfer rates at zero driving force of ca. lo2 ( X = Cl ) , lo3 ( X = Br ) , and los ( X = I ) M-I s-l at 50 0C.27 Since the Mc-Cl ( 72.4 f 0.9 kcal / mol19 ) and CCl3-C1 ( 68.9 f 0.7 kcal / molZ8 ) bond energies are very similar , our data ( Table I ) implicate a greater intrinsic barrier for the C1 transfer to the Mo radical from CCl , than for the entirely metal - centered process.

The pH profile of Mor - NO2 formation shows a bell - shaped curve with a maximum yield of 1.6 mol % ( relative to peroxynitrite ) centered around pH 9.0. Yields of Mor - NdO , on the other hand , increase until the pH reaches 10.0 and then reach a plateau ; the maximum yield of Mor - NdO is 12 mol % relative to peroxynitrite.

10.1021/ja00027a014-1,"Among the many criteria for mechanistic plausibility in organic transformations , the most fundamental is thermochemical. The enthalpy or free energy change in each step of a proposed mechanism must conform to reasonable expectations for that mechanism to be accepted for a given reaction. Accordingly , estimation schemes for the heats of formation of reactive inter- mediates , for which experimental thermochemical data are sparse , are widely used. These schemes , such as Benson 's group equiv- alents,2 are usually based on an additivity assumption. Even the correction for systematic errors in ab initio heats of formation3 by calculation of a homcdesmotic reaction relies upon an implicit assumption of additive increments to AHf by component parts of a molecule. Used properly , group or bond additivity schemes adequately predict AHf for closed - shell molecules , and even for organic radical^,^ to within a few kcal / mol. For carbenes and biradicals though , additivity has a mixed record of predictions , of which the best one can say is that the predictions rest upon no solid thermochemical database and are of uncertain reliability. This uncertainty rests at the very crux of mechanistic controversies in which the plausibility of a carbene or biradical intermediate along a reaction coordinate is judged by an estimate of AHf for that putative intermediate.5 The uncertainty in Ur[carbene or biradical ] is equivalent to saying that , while we can predict the bond dissociation energy in a molecule to give a radical , we can not predict with certainty the second bond dissociation energy which takes that radical to a carbene or biradical .","150, 151, 201, 202, 266, 267",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

10.1021/ja000289k-3,"Although it has been shown in a number of reports that intermediates such as 2 and 3 are involved in iron(III) porphyrin complex - catalyzed oxygenations of hydrocarbons , is not completely clear which reactive species ( e.g. , 2 , 3 , or both 2 and 3 at the same time ) are responsible for oxygen atom transfer in the catalytic oxygenation reactions performed at room temperature and what factors are important to determine the nature of the reactive intermediates in iron porphyrin model systems. In this paper , we report the results of the competitive epoxidations studied with cis- and trans-stilbenes and with cyclooctene and trans-stilbene in iron(III) porphyrin - catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by oxidants such as H2O2 , tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( t-BuOOH ) , and m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid ( m-CPBA ) in protic and aprotic solvents at room temperature. We found from the studies that both the intermediates ( i.e. , 2 and 3 ) indeed function as reactive species in the epoxidation of olefins by iron porphyrins at room temperature and that the participation of 2 and 3 as reactive epoxidizing intermediates is found to be controlled by the factors such as the solvent system ( i.e. , protic and aprotic solvents ) , the presence of a proton source in aprotic solvent , and the acidity of alcohol solvents. Furthermore , we report for the first time that a high - valent iron(IV) oxo porphyrin cation radical intermediate containing nonbulky ortho-fluoro substituents at the phenyl groups of electron - deficient porphyrin ligand shows an unexpected prefer- ence for trans-stilbene over cis-stilbene in the competitive epoxidations of cis- and trans-stilbenes .","20, 21, 21, 22, 27, 28, 56, 57, 82, 83, 83, 84, 102, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 110, 111, 115, 116, 120, 121, 125, 126, 132, 133, 167, 168, 169, 170, 170, 171, 222, 223, 239, 240, 245, 246, 249, 250, 255, 256, 263, 264, 265, 266, 273, 274",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

A photochromic reaction occurring within 50 ps after ultraviolet ( 287 nm ) irradiation produces merocyanine species which absorb at 574 nm in both polar and nonpolar solvents. For as long as 1.5 ns , neither absorption nor resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals any changes in the merocyanine isomer ( s ) initially formed. In polar solvents , a second transient absorption ( 400-460 nm ) appears both before the merocyanine isomer ( s ) is formed and whenever the merocyanine isomer ( s ) is excited at 574 nm. No back - reaction from the merocyanine isomer ( s ) to the spiro form is observed when the sample is irradiated at either 574 or 425 nm with delays of 100 ps to 1 ns after 287-nm excitation.

In perchloric acid a more complex structure is observed which , like the sulfate and nitrate systems , is also not close packed. In acetate , a close - packed monolayer is formed. The different monolayer structures give rise to packing densities which correlate with electrolyte size , except in the case of perchloric acid. However , there is little agreement between packing densities predicted from coulometric measurements and those actually observed with the AFM. The discrepancy between the two measurements is ascribed to differing amounts of charge transfer between electrolyte and adatom which alters the amount of charge needed for upd lattice formation .","20, 21, 22, 23, 50, 51, 69, 70, 86, 87, 88, 89, 97, 98",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Specific protection of the 4-hydroxyl group was accomplished by a Mit- sunobu protocol.6 Compound 10 , thus obtained in 92 % yield , was converted to aryl triflate 11 through the agency of triflic anhydride-pyridine.'

Peroxovanadium(V) species oxidize iodide ; however , dioxovanadium(V) is reduced by iodide in acid,9 consistent with the observed decrease in the 51V NMR signal over time of the reaction solution under catalytic conditions ( data not shown ). Further , we have found that dioxovanadium(V) catalyzes the oxidation of chloride by hydrogen peroxide , and the formation of chlorotrimethoxybenzene ( Cl - TMB ; M+ m / e 202 , 204 ) , al- though the chlorination rate is slower than that for bromination. Thus we have shown that dioxovanadium(V) catalyzes the bromination of TMB and the bromide - assisted disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , analogous to the reactivity of the V-BrPO enzyme ( Scheme 11 ; in this scheme , HOBr , Br , and Br,- are in rapid equilibration ).

Since the Act polyketide synthase specifies an octaketide intermediate , the fact that fcmW acfl - ORF2 restored the production of 1 to WMH1068 , via a decaketide intermediate , strongly suggests that the chain length factor alone is not sufficient to control the chain length.

The decrease in entropy associated with tethering the two reactive components suggests that the reaction would be significantly more facile than the intermolecular reaction.25 However , this potential rate enhancement is com- promised by the dramatic decrease in rate associated with intermolecular cycloadditions with substituted norbomadienes as described previously. There were no reported examples of successful intramolecular HDA reactions in the literature prior to 1992.5d,26 In an intramolecular reaction , there are two possible modes of [ 2n + 227 + 2271 cycloaddition which have to be considered ( Scheme 3 ). The dienophile in the tether can cyclize on Ca- Cb-CC to give a cycloadduct of type I or it can cyclize on Cd- Ce-Cf to give a type I1 cycloadduct. Molecular models and MM2 calculations indicate that both products would be stable .","17, 18, 67, 68, 115, 116, 137, 138",,,,,,,,,,Products,,,,,,,"7,8,8,9,9,10",intramolecular HDA reaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Crystals of [4][Br] belong to the monoclinic space group C2 / c ; a summary of pertinent intra- and intermolecular distances is provided in Table 2. The crystal structure consists of ribbon - like arrays of alternating [4]’+ radical cations and bromide anions strung together along two-fold axes running parallel to the y direction ; these ribbons form in-register layers in the xy plane , as shown in Figure 4. The ribbons are layered in the z direction , each layer being offset from the one above and below so that the halide ion of one layer is approximately aligned with the internal S-S bond of one of the CN & rings in the layers above and below it.

10.1021/ja00131a031-0,"Department of Chemistry and Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter , University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6323 Received March 27 , I995 A common goal in sensory materials is increased sensitivity , which has led to great interest in fluorescence - based chemosen- sors.' However , in spite of progress in instrumentation and materials , there is an ever increasing need for the detection of trace analytes. Increasing the association constant of the recognition ( binding ) event increases a sensory device 's sen- sitivity. Unfortunately , such an approach to enhanced sensitivity can have the disadvantage of irreversible responses or very long reset times. An additional limitation is that receptors with sufficiently high association constants may not be available. In this report we demonstrate a new method for enhancing the sensitivity of a fluorescence - based chemosensor , which may be used in conjunction with , but does not require , an increased association constant. This method makes use of the special electronic properties of conjugated polymers , which results in an amplified response due to the efficient energy migration to occupied receptor sites .",,,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Isoalloxazine 48 was selected as an FAD surrogate because of its high solubility in DMF .","37, 38, 98, 99, 101, 102, 105, 106, 115, 116, 167, 168, 191, 192, 193, 194, 201, 202, 218, 219, 242, 243, 249, 250, 255, 256, 263, 264","218,219,221,222","242,243",,"207,208,208,209",,,,,,Reaction,"101,102,102,103,103,104,105,106",flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD,"124,125,125,126,126,127,127,128,128,129,129,130",acetyl phosphate and C O Z,,,"95,96",oxidation,,,,,"255,256,256,257,262,263,263,264",FAD surrogate in DMF,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Emission and nanosecond to microsecond transient absorption studies of 1 in organic solvents such as MeOH , MeCN , and CH2Cl2 indicate that the lowest excited state of the complex is a dppz - based intraligand triplet state ( 31Ldppz ). The 31Ldppz state is characterized by weak room temperature phosphorescence and a strong TO = 470 nm. Absorption and emission studies of 1 in aqueous solution with added DNA indicate that the complex binds to the biopolymer , persumably by intercalation of the dppz ligand. Complex 1 is non-luminescent in aqueous solution ; however , 31Ldppz phosphorescence is observed from the DNA - bound form of the complex in aqueous solution.

A plot of ipa against the square root of the scan speed is linear across a range of 0.050 - 0.500 V s-l ( correlation coefficient > 0.99 ) , as expected for a diffusion - controlled electrode process , and the measurement of the ratio iP & = 1 for the two waves showed the chemical reversibility of the two one - electron transfers. The data for peak potentials and current peak ratio are compiled in Table 1. The comparison of these potentials with that of the corresponding monomer 3 demonstrates the electron - donor effect of the second iron center reducing the first oxidation potential by 0.55 V. The role of the electron- donating-C4 - bridge is also illustrated by comparison of the oxidation potential of the monocation 5+ and the monomer 3 ; it is large enough to balance the electron - withdrawing effect of the positive charge .","140, 141",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

The hydrosilylation mechanism is discussed in terms of a hydride / alkyl cycle involving rapid , exothermic olefin insertion into an Ln-H bond followed by turnover - limiting Si-WLn-alkyl transposition ( delivery of the alkyl group to Si ) .","9, 10, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24, 25, 54, 55, 79, 80, 94, 95, 130, 131, 140, 141, 143, 144, 146, 147, 178, 179, 180, 181, 186, 187, 190, 191, 197, 198, 203, 204, 206, 207","79,80,81,82,84,85,85,86","130,131,132,133",,"96,97,97,98",,,,"110,111,112,113",,Reactants,"79,80,81,82,84,85,85,86",2-phenyl-l-butene (R)-MezSiCp (-)-menthyl Cp]SmCH(SiMe,"130,131,132,133",PhCD(CH3)(CH2CH3) PhSiH2D,,,"96,97,97,98",asymmetric hydrosilylation,,,,,,,"110,111,112,113",25 C,,,,,Validate annotation
10.1021/ja00132a018-0,"Abstract : The geometry and electronic structure of 0-methyl methylphosphonofluoridate ( 1 ) ( MeOPOFMe ) have been determined at the MP2 / 6-31G(D) and Becke3LYP / 6-31G(D) levels. The calculations confirm the prior results of lower - level ab initio calculations which indicated that the experimental gas phase electron diffraction structure of 1 is substantially in error. The compound exists in a single conformation determined by the operation of an anomeric effect between the methoxy oxygen atom and the P-F bond as is evident from the nearly perpendicular orientation of the 0-C and P-F bonds. A reanalysis of the published gas electron diffraction ( GED ) data yielded inconclusive results but underscored the inability of GED to distinguish between the conformations of 1. 'H and I3C NMR spectra are reported and are consistent with the existence of a single conformer. The lower excited singlet states of 1 are calculated to be Rydberg states originating from excitations from the p - type nonbonding orbitals of the monocoordinated oxygen atom into diffuse 3s- and 3p - type orbitals. The transitions are predicted to occur in the vacuum W and have low oscillator strength. The Fist two transitions have moderate positive rotatory strength for the ( R ) enantiomer , leading to the prediction of absolute configuration , (+)-(R)-1 .","9, 10, 75, 76, 76, 77, 80, 81, 94, 95, 167, 168",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Thus , the ultimate formation of a mixture of diene geometric isomers can be understood in terms of a mechanism in which ring opening occurs in stereospecific , disrotatory fashion on the excited state surface to yield a single , electroni- cally excited diene. The overall non-stereoselectivity results from the manner in which the excited product decays to the ground state , primarily by E,Z - isomerization. In conventional terms , our results suggest that ring opening follows the excited state pathway predicted by orbital symmetry rules , but the avoided crossing for disrotatory cyclobutenelbutadiene inter- conver ~ ion ~ , ~ is bypassed to allow access to the same region of the excited state potential energy surface that is accessed predominantly when the single diene isomer is itself excited directly.

We orient ferredoxin : NADP+ reductase molecules onto a modified gold electrode by introducing a genetically engineered metal binding site on a selected region of the protein surface and covering the gold surface with a self - assembled monolayer of thiols appended with nitrilotriacetic acid groups complexed with metal transition ions. Two mutants were designed to have a histidine pair ( His- X3 - His ) on surface - exposed R-helices located in one of the two protein domains. It was first demonstrated that the mutant proteins in solution retain their full activity and that the kinetic constants of the redox catalytic steps are not affected by the mutations. The enzyme - modified gold electrodes were then analyzed for the amount and distribution of protein on their surface and for their activity using atomic force microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The two electrode - bound mutant enzymes manifested differences in the amount and distribution of bound molecules , in the kinetic constants of their redox catalytic steps , and most interestingly , in their ability to transfer electrons to a redox mediator covalently attached to the self - assembled monolayer. We conclude that the position of the mutated R-helix determined the orientation of the protein with respect to the surface and , as a result , its competence to establish direct electrical communication with the electrode .","28, 29, 64, 65, 67, 68, 82, 83",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Extensive regio- and diastereospecific labeling experiments were conducted to gain further insight into the mechanistic details , in particular the stereoselectivity of the Co+ - induced demethanation in the gas phase. The overall reaction follows a 1,2-elimination mode , and , with regard to the regiospecificity , the neutral methane originates exclusively from the ( w-2 ) and ( 0-1 ) positions of the alkyl chain. For 2 and 3 the examination of diastereospecifically labeled isotopomers reveals that the gas - phase demethanation exhibits a remarkable diastereoselectivity. This unprecedented example for a stereoselective C-C bond activation in gas - phase organometallic chemistry can be accounted for in terms of steric features of the metallacyclic intermediates .","11, 12, 25, 26, 60, 61, 86, 87, 101, 102, 130, 131",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Small fractal domains initially grew and then coalesced into several large domains. Very weak birefringence and fine structure without any anisotropy are characteristic of this phase. It is interesting to note that two different domains exist showing the opposite sign of optical rotation. Strong circular dichroism ( CD ) with a peak at 430 nm was also observed for each domain with the opposite sign. The results suggest a natural occurrence of the helix in these materials.

10.1021/ja001372a-0,"Chiral lithium amides have been utilized as bases in asymmetric deprotonation reactions and as chiral auxiliaries in other reactions.1 Koga and others have shown that chiral lithium amides can lead to high stereoselectivities in aldol and related reactions.2 The effect of these chiral lithium amides in aldol reactions , generally referred to as the Li - amide effect,3 is likely to arise from mixed aggregates containing both lithium enolates and lithium amides. Conse- quently , identification of these aggregates , including their struc- tural details , are important for designing and choosing chiral amines and for probing the origin of the stereoselectivity in asymmetric reactions involving these species. Previously , we isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction mixed aggregates containing Li - enolates and achiral Li - amides.4 We and others have suggested the importance of these species in enolate reactions.5 We now wish to report definitive evidence for a simple enolate , chiral lithium amide complex that we ’ve purposefully designed.

The orientation of the principal axes of the chemical shift tensor has been estimated using ab initio calculations of the tensors. The calculated shift tensors for the axial and equatorial isomers of methylcyclohexane , which are also presented in this paper , are almost identical to those from the 3,5-dimethyl-substituted compound. This indicates that chemical shift tensors for a methyl group are primarily determined by local electronic and steric factors.

10.1021/ja00138a004-0,"Abstract : Poly(o-aminobenzylphosphonic acid ) and its sodium salts , made by progressive neutralization with NaOH , have been prepared and characterized. Both the hemisodium and monosodium salts are intrinsically self - doped and water - soluble in the conducting form. The key is to control the ionization of the excess acid functions on the polymer chains. XPS results suggest that the polymer is obtained directly in the 43 % polyzwitterionic ( Le. , self - doped ) emeraldine form. The self - doped polymer does not exhibit any conductivity dependence on pH below 6 , in marked contrast to the HC1 - doped polyanilines. Our structurally well - defined polymer system displays only one set of redox activity over the potential range of -0.2 to 1.2 eV , alluding to the higher stability of the self - doped structure. This is unique and different from other polyaniline systems which show two sets of redox peaks. FTIR spectroscopy provides evidence for strong intra-chain hydrogen bonding while NMR studies conclude that protonated and S cm- ’ ) unprotonated segments of the solvated monosodium polymer are distinct. The lower conductivity obtained is attributed to the decrease in conjugation caused by the large steric effect of the bulky PO3H2 and a significant hydrogen bond interaction between P02(0H)- and NH’+ leading to significant charge - pinning.

10.1021/ja00138a017-1,"The decarboxylation of benzisoxazole-3-carboxylic acids to form salicylonitriles has been investigated in extraordinary detail by Kemp et al. ’ The reaction involves the conversion of the conjugate base of benzisoxazole-3-carboxylic acid ( 1 ) to cy- anophenoxide 3 , without formation of an intermediate ( Scheme 1 ). The reaction rate is enormously sensitive to solvent polarity. There is a 108-fold increase in rate on changing the reaction medium from polar protic ( H20 ) to polar aprotic ( hexameth- ylphosphoramide ). This has been explained by ( 1 ) stabilization of the carboxylate in protic media by hydrogen bonding , which raises the activation energy , and ( 2 ) stabilization of the charge- delocalized transition state , 2 through dispersion interactions with polarizable media. The second explanation rests on the assumption that the extended n-system is easier to polarize in the transition state than in the ground state.

The structures of 12 of these have been determined by X-ray crystallography and are reported here in full. These guest molecules of differing size and shape can result in significant alteration to the unit cell and canal dimensions but do not cause disruption of the helical tubuland lattice type itself.

In addition , two structurally isomeric metallodendrimers ( 16 and 17 ) were designed , synthesized , and characterized. These two isomers were spectrally alike and displayed very similar physical and chemical properties ; however , the internal density and void regions of these molecules were differentiated by cyclic voltammetry. The effects of the bulkiness of internal and external dendritic branches on the terpyridine-ruthenium complexes are described. A similar synthetic strategy allowed the preparation of two generations of neutral metallomacromolecules ( 33 and 36 ) possessing no external counterions.

10.1021/ja00140a011-1,"1,2-Diazene , also known as diimide , N2H2 , is widely used for reducing multiple bonds.' It is highly selective and stereospecific and has been in wide use since the early 1960s. An unusual feature of its chemistry is that diazene is believed to react through a pericyclic transition state , with both hydrogen atoms donating across the multiple bond. In recent experimental investigations we have measured the kinetics of diimide reduction of itself in aqueous media , i.e. , its disproportionation.2 We found that the rate law , rate constant , and activation parameters were in agreement with ab initio calculations based on the following scenario : ( 1 ) trans-NzH2 is in solvent - catalyzed equilibrium with its high - energy cis isomer , and ( 2 ) the cis isomer donates both hydrogen atoms in a concerted pericyclic manner with virtually no activation enthalpy , the transition state being highly entropy controlled. The ab initio calculations also indicated a very similar picture for the reduction of eth ~ lene. ~ An interesting outcome of this computational study was the recognition that electron correlation must be taken into account in order to obtain a qualitatively correct picture of the potential energy surface : high activation energies rather than activation- less reactions were obtained in prior computational studies of olefin hydrogenation by diazene and its disproportionation that omitted electron ~ orrelation. ~ - ~ The concept of solvent- catalyzed isomerization of diazene has subsequently been supported and refined in ab initio results reported by McKee.'O","0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 40, 41, 53, 54, 70, 71, 111, 112, 135, 136, 220, 221, 223, 224, 242, 243",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

10.1021/ja00140a023-0,"Abstract : We have investigated fluorine substitution effects on the rate of coupling of adsorbed alkyl groups on a Ag(ll1) surface. Alkyl groups are formed by thermal dissociation of the C-I bond in adsorbed alkyl iodides. Variable heating rate temperature programmed reaction ( TPR ) studies were used to determine the kinetic parameters for the coupling of ethyl groups and propyl groups. They are Ea = 15.1 f 0.6 kcallmol , Y = 10'6.7*0.8 S-I and E , = 16.9 f 0.4 kcallmol , Y = 1017.1*0.4 s-l , respectively. Substitution of fluorine for hydrogen in the adsorbed alkyl groups systematically raises the coupling reaction temperature. For example , trifluoropropyl groups self - couple at temperatures -70 K higher than propyl groups on Ag( 11 1 ). Coadsorbed propyl and trifluoropropyl groups cross- couple at temperatures -10 K higher than the propyl self - coupling reaction. The kinetic parameters evaluated from the results of this study and from results of earlier studies by X.-L. Zhou , J. M. White , and co-workers [ S u ~ Sci. 1989 , 219 , 294 ; Catal.

Whereas previous triangular ligands all possess C3 sym- metry,1-4 panel 1 is C2 - symmetric and hence can be linked in two different ways : parallel and antiparallel links. Interestingly , these two options were perfectly controlled by the guests.5 We show that some large guests induce the parallel link of the triangles leading to open cone ( tetragonal pyramidal ) structure 3 , whereas antiparallel link is selected by some small tetrahedral guests giving closed tetrahedron structure 4 ( Scheme 1 ).

The rate constants for the reverse reaction ( k-xpy ) have also been measured for substituted pyridine leaving groups. The plots of log kxpy and log k-XPY against pKaxPY each consist of two intersecting linear correlations consistent with a two - step mechanism involving a Meisenheimer - like intermediate. The overall transfer of the triazin-2-yl group between substituted pyridines has a Peq value of 1.25.

These polymeric materials have a core - shell morphology where the interior is a functionalized polymer , that provides high affinity for a specific metal , and the shell consists of a porous hydrophobic polymer that modulates access to the core. In the present case , the nanoparticles are loaded with Gd3+ to provide contrast in magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging. The Gd3+ - loaded nanoparticles described in this paper have a diameter of 120 nm and are , therefore , small enough to pass easily through the vasculature. These particles have been shown to reduce relaxation times in vitro , and provide excellent contrast when used to image the heart and gastrointestinal tract in a rat animal model .","73, 74, 85, 86",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

10.1021/ja00142a001-0,"Abstract : The intramolecular aldol condensation of keto-aldehyde 1 yields a substituted 2-benzyl-3-hydroxy- cyclohexanone 2 and subsequently 2-benzyl-2-cyclohexenone ( 3 ). The sequence involves four individual reaction steps. Three of these steps can be accelerated using general acid - base catalysis to effect proton transfer at or near the a-carbon of the ketone involved in the condensation , which is at the homobenzylic position relative to the aromatic group of the substrate ( Ar ). An antibody to the corresponding N-benzyl-N-methylpiperidinium hapten 5 was found to catalyze the entire reaction sequence. This antibody seems to act purely as a general base and does not catalyze the carbon-carbon bond forming step. Catalysis of the aldol elimination is selective for the disfavored trans- elimination with a single enantiomer of stereoisomer 2a. Catalysis is suppressed by incubating the antibody with a carboxyl-specific reagent , suggesting that a carboxyl group acts as a general base to catalyze the sequence. The antibody is approximately 2.0 x lo5 times more reactive than acetate for catalysis of the sequence.

10.1021/ja00142a008-0,"Abstract : The role of local steric influences on the solution conformation and the biological activity of the H - type II blood group determinant 1 has been evaluated using structurally modified trisaccharides 2-4 and their corresponding C1 - substituted C-glycosides 5-8 as conformational models. The preference of the C-glycosidic bond to adopt the gauche “ exo-anomeric ” conformation and the removal of destabilizing 1,3-diaxial - like interactions on the C-aglyconic bond have been used to create predictable conformational characteristics in C-trisaccharides 5-8. Vicinal coupling constants from ‘ H NMR spectroscopy and 2D NOESY spectroscopy demonstrate that structural modifications in the C-trisaccharides result in large changes in their conformational preferences. To test the impact of solution conformation on receptor - ligand recognition , the affinities of compounds 1-8 toward the lectin I of Ulex europaeus ( UEA-I ) have been investigated using a quantitative binding assay. The binding affinities of the H - type 11 trisaccharide 1 and the corresponding carbon analog 5 are virtually identical. The activities of the structurally modified C-trisaccharides 6-8 decrease sharply relative to the unmodified C-trisaccharide 5 , correlating conformation to binding affinity. A parallel gradient in binding affinity is observed for the 0-trisaccharides 1-4. The selectivity of UEA-I for epitopes 1-8 validates the assumption that its receptor site largely defines a bound conformation for the substrates , and establishes that the conformational behavior of 0-glycosides such as 1-4 is similar to that of C-glycosides such as 5-8 .","32, 33, 40, 41, 70, 71, 81, 82, 101, 102, 155, 156, 160, 161, 172, 173, 180, 181, 230, 231, 239, 240",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

10.1021/ja00142a012-0,"Abstract : A new strategy has been devised for the construction of photoactive multicomponent arrays based on metal ion chelation whereby bisporphyrins have been assembled around a central ruthenium( @ bis(terpyridy1) complex. One of the terminal subunits is a gold(II1) porphyrin while the second terminus is selected from a gold(III) , zinc(II) , or free - base porphyrin. Photophysical properties have been measured for each of the tripartite compounds using ultrafast transient absorption and emission spectroscopy. Excitation into the central ruthenium(I1) bis(terpyridy1) complex is followed by rapid intramolecular triplet energy transfer to one of the appended porphyrins. Direct excitation into the gold(II1) porphyrin subunit generates the corresponding triplet excited state which is unreactive toward energy- or electron - transfer processes. In contrast , excitation into the zinc(II) or free - base porphyrin produces the corresponding excited singlet state which transfers an electron to the adjacent ruthenium(II) bis(terpyridy1) complex. Secondary electron transfer to the appended gold(II1) porphyrin competes with reverse electron transfer such that the redox equivalents become separated by about 30 A. The original ground - state system is restored by relatively slow interporphyrin electron transfer. The energetics for each of these electron - transfer steps have been evaluated from electrochemical measurements and by measuring the rates as a function of temperature and solvent polarity. For the zinc(I1) porphyrin - containing triad , electron transfer takes place in the solid state at 77 K. Finally , the performance of the latter triad is compared with that of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center complex .","21, 22, 40, 41, 49, 50, 51, 52, 102, 103, 126, 127, 131, 132, 145, 146, 155, 156, 217, 218, 218, 219",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Irradiation of l*Ac at 320 nm in a methyltetrahydrofuran ( MTHF ) matrix at 77 K yields a species with a lifetime of 10.1 ms and an emission spectrum containing the four vibrational bands charcteristic of acetophenone phosphorescence. In order to determine if triplet energy would be transferred through the skeleton of l*Ac , samples in which naphthalene was added to the MTHF matrix were irradiated. As the concentration of naphthalene in the MTHF matrix was increased , l*Ac phos- phorescence intensity decreased while naphthalene phospho- rescence was induced. Naphthalene phosphorescence was not seen upon direct irradiation of naphthalene , so triplet energy must be transferred through the skeleton of 1 in these experi- ments.

10.1021/ja00143a007-0,"Abstract : Construction of sulfones in enantiomerically pure form provides a great opportunity to enhance their value as synthetic building blocks. Allylic sulfones , in particular , have great flexibility derived from sulfone - controlled additions to the double bond. Two strategies have been developed based upon the ability to effect asymmetric allylic alkylations with palladium employing ligands derived from c2 symmetric diamines and 2-(dipheny1phosphino)- benzoic acid. Desymmetrization of meso-2-ene- 1 ,Cdiol diesters does not involve the nucleophile in the enantio- discriminating step and thus should , a priori , not depend upon the nature of the nucleophile. Indeed , such desymmetrization of such a diester in the presence of a sulfinate anion gave excellent enantioselectivity. On the other hand , conversion of both enantiomeric allylic esters to enantiomerically pure allylic sulfones requires sodium benzenesulfinate to participate in the enantiodiscriminating step. Five- , six- , and seven - membered substrates all gave excellent enantioselectivities. A catalytic phase transfer system proved most efficacious on larger scales. Propagating the asymmetry requires diastereoselective functionalization of the double bond. While epoxidation proved excellent for the five - membered ring case and satisfactory for the six - membered ring case , it was unsatisfactory in the seven - membered ring case. Osmium tetroxide - catalyzed cis-dihydroxylation gave excellent diastereoselectivities in the six- and seven - membered ring cases. Reductive cleavages produced enantiomerically pure allylic alcohols. Base - catalyzed elimination generated enantiomerically pure y-hydroxy-a,B-unsaturated sulfones from which further stereogenic centers were produced by diastereoselective conjugate additions. Notably , an asymmetric cyclopentenone annulation using palladium - catalyzed cycloadditions now derives from racemic allyl alcohols .","4, 5, 22, 23, 32, 33, 55, 56, 62, 63, 105, 106, 111, 112, 131, 132, 238, 239, 254, 255, 257, 258, 265, 266",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

When an alkyne is used as the organic substrate , we find that a high yield route can be developed to afford a class of stable alkylidyne complexes of the type [ Re( = CCHzR)Hz(mq)- (PPh3)2]+.

Be- cause of their delocalized electronic structure and relatively narrow band gap ( ca. 4 eV ) , polysilanes provide a new class of charge - transporting and photoconducting materials. They ex- hibit a strong near-W absorption that results from a-conjugation along the silicon backbone , and the radiation sensitivity associ- ated with this transition makes these polymers suitable for applications in microlithography. The primary synthetic route that has been used to explore polysilanes is the Wurtz - coupling of dichlorosilanes by alkali metal^.^ This method has proven very useful for research purposes , but it is severely limited as a general method since it produces moderate yields , and does not tolerate many functional groups .","38, 39, 63, 64, 93, 94, 100, 101",,,,,,,,,,Reactants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

While one would expect a 1 : 2 : 1 ratio of 11 : 12 : 13 to be formed if precursors 9 and 10 were present at the same concentration and if dimerization rates for all a-amino ketones were approximately the same , it is clear that isolation of 11 and 12 to the virtual exclusion of 13 would occur if the “ North spiroketal ” precursor 9 was present in substantially greater concentration. Such a picture is consistent with the fact that the “ North spiroketal ” appears in most of the 15 known cephalostatins isolated from C. gilchristi and is also in accord with the finding that cephalostatin 7 ( 12 ) is isolated in 10-fold lower yields than cephalostatin 12 ( 11 ). 2 $ 6","29, 30, 43, 44, 54, 55, 55, 56, 75, 76, 133, 134, 191, 192, 205, 206, 217, 218","44,45,46,47","54,55,55,56,56,57,57,58,58,59,59,60,75,76,76,77,77,78,78,79,79,80,84,85,85,86,86,87",,"128,129",,,,,,Reaction,"42,43,43,44,44,45,46,47",a-amino ketones 9 10,"54,57,58,59,75,77,78,79,84,86,86,87",pyrazine cephalostatin 7 12 cephalostatin 126 11 ritterazine K (13)3b,,,"128,129",dimerization,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation
