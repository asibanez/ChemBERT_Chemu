246	Compound 3o ( 99 % ee , after semipreparative high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) enantioseparation ) was then selected as the ligand for the palladium catalyzed allylic alkylation. Gratifyingly , the reaction of racemic 18 and malonate 19 proceeded effectively with 2 mol % of palladium catalyst and 4 mol % of 3o to give the desired product 20 in 95 % yield with 97 % ee. Aside from 3o , compound 3u ( 99 % ee , recrystallization with Et2O / hexane ) could also work well in this type of reaction with indole as the nucleophile , indicating that the resulted highly enantioenriched axially chiral arylpyrrole is capable of inducing the chirality in asymmetric synthesis ( Fig. 4a )
